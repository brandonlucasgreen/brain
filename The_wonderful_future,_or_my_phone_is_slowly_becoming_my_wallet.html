Back in NYC or up in Salem, most of the establishments we frequent only accepted certain credit cards; many were cash-only.</p><p>Now, I can use Apple Pay or order online from pretty much anywhere I frequent - cabs &amp; Uber, groceries from Trader Joe’s, Starbucks and most other local chains - for everything else, I’m only really using one of two debit/credit cards. My only actual use for cash, except when I’m not in Boston, is to pay my barber every month. This has been a wonderful way to live, if anything because I have to worry about having less with me at any given time. My only further request is that I could get my driver’s license and MBTA subway pass somehow onto my iPhone - then I could ditch my wallet almost completely.</p><p>Having a thinner wallet is kind of amazing, but my iPhone is starting to feel like a <strong>single point of failure</strong>. What if I drop it and crack the screen or damage the NFC chip or the Touch ID button? The 6s Plus has amazing battery life<span data-nosnippet=""><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></span>, but what if it dies? Do I replace my wallet with my little Anker portable charger in my back pocket? What if I lose or forget that? What if I get mugged? Or worst yet, what if I lose the phone due to my own idiocy? **How will I get my goddamn Venti iced coffee? **</p><p>It gets me thinking about product redundancy - the physical wallet begins to act as backup for my virtual Wallet. But what happens when I have no need for a physical wallet anymore, other than to cover my ass if my phone dies? That’s kind of an annoying prospect? Is that what Apple’s betting on with the Apple Watch, if you ignore the lifestyle play? When does the “all-powerful device” with several obvious Achilles heels require redundancy, especially when you don’t want to also carry your phone in an Otterbox case and with a portable charger constantly?</p><p>It’s all really fascinating, is all. It’s interesting to me that we still don’t have a good, trusted, redundant solution here that’s also convenient and cheap. We have it with our digital files thanks to name-your-cloud-storage-and/or-backup solution, but credit cards, identification and other highly physical-world things are still confined in your pocket or purse one way or another.</p><p>I get excited for our inevitable <em>Minority Report</em>-like future in which we could have public kiosks where, via a retina or thumbprint scan, you could retrieve a temporary copy of your ID, driver’s license, last credit card used, or whatever you lost while out in the world. Dropped your phone and it’s useless? Scan your finger at a Touch ID kiosk and you can automatically have a temporary ATM card printed instantly for use. Got mugged or lost your phone in an unfamiliar place? A quick scan could get you quick access to emergency response care, your Medical ID and history, and/or automatically wipe your phone and notify a loved one that you’re okay. I don’t know nearly enough about the technical complexity of making this work in practice - the scanners would need to be sanitary, damage-resistant, weather-proof, whatever else - clearly there are a lot of holes to this. It’s almost certainly easily hackable if we’re not careful.</p><p>But it’d at least be super cool, right?</p><h1 id="product-hunt-for-abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz">Product Hunt for abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</h1><p>The other day I came across <a href="http://www.telescopeapp.org">Telescope</a>, a product that lets anyone launch their own community site, Product Hunt-style. Just when you think you’ve seen too many “Product Hunt for X” sites, someone gives you the ability to generate as many of them as humanly possible.</p><p>It’s not inherently a bad or stupid idea, I swear. But every time someone develops some sort of platform that “lets you make your very own X”, I get a little terrified at the implications that platform may have on society - or, more specifically, the silly ideas that the platform enables. If the “Uber for X” mentality gave us things like <a href="http://www.bottlestonightapp.com">this</a>, I can’t imagine what a well-marketed “Product Hunt for X” solution gives us.</p><p>Because I get bored during my commute sometimes, I came up with a few ideas for Telescope sites that I thought might be good<span data-nosnippet=""><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">2</a></sup></span>. Yay for rapid brainstorming!</p><ul><li><strong>Anxiety Hunt</strong>: submit what’s making you anxious at any particular moment; others can upvote the things that they’re <em>also</em> anxious about. Let’s all be upfront about our insecurities, k? (Speaking of which, is Post Secret still a thing?)</li><li><strong>Bitch Hunter Hunt</strong>: Upvote the best lines from the amazing, non-existent movie starring Will Ferrell, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLa_beHZfws"><em>Bitch Hunter</em></a>.</li><li><strong>Crack Overflow</strong>: Stack Overflow, but for people who periodically suffer from plumber’s crack. (What do you post on a site like that? I don’t know, I wear skinny jeans.)</li><li><strong>Duck Duck Hunt Hunt</strong>: post and upvote screenshots and videos of your favorite moments from the classic game, Duck Hunt.</li><li><strong>Ethan Hunt</strong>: Product Hunt for all things Mission: Impossible.</li><li><strong>Fuck Hunt</strong>: Basically, Product Hunt for porn. V2: import the top voted porn images into a live web version of Duck Hunt!</li><li><strong>Grunt Hunt</strong>: Inspired by Eugene Mirman’s <em>I’m Sorry, You’re Welcome</em>, this gem lets users upload and vote on the best interpretations of various sound effects performed by their own speaking voice.</li><li><strong>Helen Hunt</strong>: Product Hunt for all people in the world named Helen. Vote which ones you think are the best! Except <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Hunt">Helen Hunt</a>, of course.</li><li><strong>I Hunt Myself</strong>: For the ultimate narcissist, this platform allows you to submit virtually anything you care about and upvote them based on your personal ranking of those things. The twist? You’re the only one who can access your list. And every upvote triggers a little “Me me me!” sound effect.</li><li><strong>Jerk Hunt</strong>: Product Hunt for douchebags. You literally post about a shitty person and something shitty they did, and people agree with you. The worst people are highest voted. We’re terrible people, right?</li><li><strong>Karma Hunt</strong>: Post something good you did for somebody, and people upvote the most charitable acts. Do you get any actual good karma from this? Probably not. It’s mostly self-serving.</li><li><strong>Luck Hunt</strong>: Product Hunt, but if you’re the Xth person to upvote something, you win money. THIS IS THE NEXT LEVEL OF FANTASY SPORTS, BABIES.</li><li><strong>Meta Hunt</strong>: Product Hunt for “Product Hunt for X” sites. Product Hunt is sort of already this, but I figure let’s cut out the BS and make a site dedicated to this thing.</li><li><strong>Nuck Hunt</strong>: Same as the aforementioned Fuck Hunt, but for Canadians.</li><li><strong>Oregon Trail, Telescope Edition</strong>: This version of insanity takes the original beloved computer game, The Oregon Trail, and puts every possible scenario in a list. You have a limited number of upvotes and can use them toward rations, game, diseases - literally everything the game has to offer - and the game returns a likeliness of you surviving the Oregon Trail with those decisions. Basically, a way less fun version of the game.</li><li><strong>Problem Hunt</strong>: Upvote actual problems around which people should build products to solve - they can be any problems, large or small. (Disclaimer: this one’s kind of a real idea, and it already existed once as Real Problem Hunt but was shut down - I think this deserves to come back at some point.)</li><li><strong>Quote Pilot</strong>: You know all those sites with huge lists of inspirational quotes? Ever want to make your own soundbyte-y quote? Submit it here and people upvote the most moving ones. Because we need more inspirational quotes every day!</li><li><strong>Reverse Hunt</strong>: Vote for the least cool things. The less votes, the better. Countercultures, unite.</li><li><strong>Sidetracked: the Game</strong>: submit something that distracted you today - anything at all. Other people upvote the things also distracting them. The test: seeing how many of those things you can avoid clicking on. It’s totally a game!</li><li><strong>Telescope Hunt:</strong> Product Hunt for all sites made with the Telescope platform. (No relation to Meta Hunt, of course…)</li><li><strong>Uber Hunt:</strong> Product Hunt for Uber drivers. Or is it Uber for Product Hunt fans? THE WORLD MAY NEVER KNOW!</li><li><strong>Viral Hunt</strong>: Product Hunt, but with auto-sharing upon every upvote. You thought you couldn’t post any more content to your followers? Think again!</li><li><strong>Witch Hunt:</strong> Post people you think are witches, and then others can upvote if they agree with you. Then we burn the highest-voted ones at the stake!</li><li><strong>X for Product Hunt</strong>: Post and upvote features for Product Hunt. (This isn’t actually that bad of an idea for a feature request tool…?)</li><li><strong>Yerba Hunté</strong>: Upvote the best kinds of maté…?</li><li><strong>Zoo Hunt</strong>: Zoo animals. Which ones are the best? I’m done with this list.</li></ul><h1 id="on-malaise-in-tech-or-how-i-learned-to-find-products-that-embrace-true-problem-solving">On malaise in tech, or how I learned to find products that embrace true problem-solving</h1><p><em>I originally wrote this for the <a href="http://mathys-potestio.com/">Mathys+Potestio</a> blog, this really cool employment agency based in Portland, Oregon. <a href="http://mathys-potestio.com/curing-tech-malaise-apps-embrace-true-problem-solving/">Here’s</a> the link to the original post.</em></p><p><strong>Apple and Google and Facebook and Microsoft and Amazon.</strong> These are the big 5 in consumer tech, and the most commonly used apps on your phone are probably made by some or all of them. Nobody is going to knock them out of their ivory towers. If you go on any tech blog you will almost certainly find no less than 3 articles in the last week about each of these 5 companies (okay, maybe a few others - but you know which ones they are).</p><p>I’m a product manager by day, so I spend a lot of time <strong>analyzing and collecting feedback</strong> on the products and how they solve <strong>real user problems.</strong> Part of my job also involves being aware of other products solving similar or other problems, so I read about those products the top tech businesses are working on, as well as new ones via sites like <a href="http://producthunt.com">Product Hunt</a>. But this is starting lose its luster for me - <a href="http://brandonlucasgreen.com/on-maker-overload-or-why-im-okay-with-not-solving-all-the-problems/">as I recently wrote on my own blog</a>, I’m becoming less and less impressed with the true <em>problem solving</em> being done by makers of products. It gets old to read about a new photo sharing app every week - why try and address the growing wealth inequality problems in the US? Or the terribly slow pace of government action? Or even the racket that is the wedding industry (a problem currently near &amp; dear to my heart)?</p><h2 id="turns-out-im-not-alone-in-my-jadedness-so-much-so-that-some-are-quitting-the-tech-journalism-beat-altogether-if-you-feel-jaded-by-this-stuff-too-its-valid---but-again-i-dont-blame-anybody-in-particular-tech-products-and-those-who-make-them-have-just-as-much-a-tendency-to-follow-trends-as-any-other-sector-of-popular-culture---social-products-smart-on-demand-services-and-lists-of-resources-are-hot-right-now-so-all-the-makers-are-trying-to-make-those-things-oh-god-what-if-someone-builds-a-social-network-for-on-demand-delivery-workers">Turns out <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/24/6839413/the-verge-today">I’m not alone</a> in my jadedness, so much so that some are <a href="http://thenextweb.com/opinion/2015/08/30/feast-on-this-you-rabid-click-dicks/">quitting the “tech journalism” beat altogether</a>. If you feel jaded by this stuff too, it’s valid - but, again, I don’t blame anybody in particular. Tech products, and those who make them, have just as much a tendency to follow trends as any other sector of popular culture - <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/search?q=social&amp;qCategory=tech">social products</a>, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/e/uber-for-x">smart on-demand services</a> and <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/search?q=resources">lists of resources</a> are hot right now, so all the makers are trying to make those things. <em>(Oh god, what if someone builds a social network for on-demand delivery workers?)</em></h2><p>Behind all the throwaway social networks and overpriced delivery apps, though, there’s even more people building truly interesting, difference-making things for the world. This is probably not a huge surprise, given the number of charitable organizations, biotech firms and activist groups out there. But hold up - you don’t need to look only at these types of groups to find great, innovative solutions being developed to solve tough social and economic problems. Startups (and even individuals) are building these things, using the same cutting-edge (and overhyped) technology and design and business models you read about on tech blogs. You know those things called “hackathons” that media has portrayed to us as high-energy bro-outs? (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxKmDWDUZ5A">Thanks, <em>The Social Network</em></a>…) These people are actually <a href="http://downtoearth.danone.com/2014/01/20/hack-the-future-now-a-hackathon-to-solve-social-issues/">using those to address social problems with great technology</a>.</p><p>In fact, if there is a social, political or economic issue that interests you, there’s probably at least a few startups or products out there aiming to tackle that issue in some way or another in some new way. Here’s just a few products that are solving real problems in critical spaces that are worth checking out (each of which even use some buzz-wordy tech or design concept you might be sick of hearing about!)</p><p><strong>Interested in helping out a charity?</strong> <a href="http://www.computeforhumanity.org">Compute for Humanity</a> uses your computer to mine cryptocurrencies, then automatically donate the output to <a href="http://www.computeforhumanity.org/financials">charities</a>. I recently installed this on my own Mac and was pleasantly surprised that it required absolutely nothing of the machine or my time, and yet in a few hours I had generated a couple bucks. I’ve generated $22.64 so far, again, for doing literally nothing.<br /><strong>Why is this remarkable?</strong> Cryptocurrencies! No work for the end-user! But also real money going to real, unsketchy charitable organizations like <a href="https://pencilsofpromise.org">Pencils of Promise</a> and <a href="https://www.globalgiving.org">GlobalGiving</a>.</p><p><strong>Want to help people with disabilities?</strong> <a href="http://www.bemyeyes.org">Be My Eyes</a> is an app that lets you help out a blind person from anywhere. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/01/16/be-my-eyes/">Remember this thing?</a> It got a fair share of journalistic praise a year ago but naturally fell out of the limelight - not for any reason in particular other than that people’s attention moved elsewhere. It’s worth reminding ourselves, however, that <strong>this is an app that literally helps blind people see.</strong> That in itself is an amazing feat we shouldn’t forget about.<br /><strong>Why is this remarkable?</strong> (Sort of) social networking! Unconventional use of the iPhone camera! But also it helps blind people.</p><p><strong>Want to be more socially conscious?</strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/archives-+-absences/id1058694048">Archives + Absences</a> is an app that notifies you anytime a cop kills a minority in the US. This is based on real data from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database">The Guardian</a> - it’s not a joke. If you are interested in the struggle of minorities in this country, you should download this app now, if anything to set context for yourself.<br /><strong>Why is this remarkable?</strong> The most minimal design ever! Push notifications! But also they’re about actual deaths surrounding a controversial social topic.</p><p><strong>Know somebody with substance abuse issues and want to try and help?</strong><a href="http://www.addicaid.com">Addicaid</a> is an app that aims to make drug &amp; alcohol recovery a little more comfortable. You can find recovery groups nearby, get tips, maintain a plan, and evaluate your progress toward recovery, all while completely anonymous if desired.<br /><strong>Why is this remarkable?</strong> Material design! But also it helps people with real, crippling problems get a little closer to solving them.</p><p><strong>Interest in the problems of America’s legal system?</strong> <a href="https://www.ravellaw.com">Ravel</a>, <a href="http://www.everlaw.com">Everlaw</a>, <a href="https://www.judicata.com">Judicata</a> and <a href="http://www.wired.com/2016/02/lawyers-fear-that-tech-will-make-their-jobs-too-easy/">others</a> aiming to make the practice of law, and lawyers, more affordable. The first two are building tools to help make law firms more efficient in their operations, and the third is aiming to capture the “law genome” to simplify complex legal decisions for lawyers and everyday people. As Judicata says, “Legal research isn’t just about finding needles; it’s about understanding the haystack too.“<br /><strong>Why is this remarkable?</strong> Big data!

It’s worth reminding ourselves that in the midst of product/maker overload, that there are millions of people making great, incredibly important products, and they’re even publicizing them - they’re just a little bit harder to find.</p><h1 id="mellowing-out">Mellowing out</h1><p>What do you do when you stop caring about something you used to love?</p><p>I moved to Salem, MA and basically stopped actively seeking live music. I still see live music - say, when my girlfriend and I go out to brunch and a jazz band happens to be performing there, or when a once-in-a-lifetime performance in the city happens - but for years I would spend hundreds of dollars almost every month trying to see as many bands as possible. There were so many possibilities, even in “<a href="http://radioboston.wbur.org/2015/07/22/tt-the-bears-closing">our music scene is dying</a>” Boston - I would frequent Great Scott and Harper’s Ferry/Brighton Music Hall and The Middle East and (begrudgingly) TT the Bear’s (just kidding, RIP).</p><p>I don’t think it’s because I’m getting older. I don’t think it’s even because bands aren’t impressing me anymore. I still listen to recorded music constantly and find new bands via blogs and Apple Music and friends’ posts.</p><p>I do think saturation has something to do with it. Software is eating the world and <a href="https://medium.com/@jwherrman/tech-is-eating-media-now-what-807047ad4ede">the Internet is eating media</a>, and both of these things are eating our ability to be surprised. The barrier to entry for anyone to become a musician is virtually gone, and it’s really easy for anyone with a slight ego to fight for your attention. The barrier to entry to start a blog or generate commentary on said music is also gone, so with every million bands that form, there are 100 million people ready to comment on said bands.</p><p>So you have tons of musicians out there, striving to outdo each other with better performances and more inventive production in order to satisfy the even more so-called critics. The caliber of the average musician is so much higher as a result - and every musician is looking to surprise you, the listener-critic, constantly. Every night holds hundreds of amazing shows competing for your time &amp; attention - secret exclusive shows, bizarre live rigs, intense theatrics, warm acoustic sets - all of which are constantly trying to compete for your interest. It’s all amazing…until it’s all the same to you.</p><h2 id="and-so-ive-become-desensitized-to-the-ability-to-be-surprised-by-live-music">And so I’ve become desensitized to the ability to be surprised by live music.</h2><p>I’ve been meaning to write about being a musician on the North Shore of MA and how live performance here is different than, say, Brooklyn or Cambridge or other major cities with credible music scenes. I wanted to write about the fact that there is a small but lively group of musicians hopping up and down the shore, playing long &amp; extremely entertaining sets in front of small, passionate North Shore crowds at quaint restaurants and bars. I wanted to write about the scene being smaller, thus allowing me to have a shot of regularly performing with a tight-knit group of collaborators.</p><p>None of that has actually happened, and that’s on me. But when you struggle to be surprised by anyone else performing, how can you expect to be inspired to surprise others with your own performance?</p><p>Goal: by April, have a live acoustic/looper set prepared and book a show. Try it out.</p><h1 id="sweet-setup-questions">Sweet Setup Questions</h1><h1 id="mac-setup">Mac Setup</h1><ul><li>Please provide some hi-res pictures of your rig, office, desk, devices, etcetera (at least 1,800 pixels wide, because: retina!).</li><li>If possible, a link to your wallpaper will save you lots of tweets.</li><li>Please answer the below questions about your Mac.</li></ul><ol><li>Who are you and what do you do?</li></ol><p>Hey! My name’s <a href="http://brandonlucasgreen.com">Brandon Green</a>. I’m a product manager by day and a songwriter/producer by night, and I’m living in mellow (but surprisingly fun) Salem, MA.</p><p>I spend my weekdays financially supporting myself at <a href="http://wayfair.com">Wayfair</a>, the leading e-commerce site for home goods, at which I manage an internal operations product. I’ve also got my hand in a few apps on the side, helping with product strategy and UX design. My work here includes an early social promotion app called <a href="http://radiary.com">Radiary</a> and another one called <a href="http://drops.nyc">AudioDrops</a> (sorry, too early to say anything about this one!).</p><p>I’m also a classically-trained pianist and self taught bassist/guitarist and have been writing music since my early teens; I’ve also been working for various tech companies based in Boston and NYC for the last 5 years or so. I release music under an alias called <strong>Sophomores</strong>, and you can check out some of my newest tunes on <a href="http://soundcloud.com/sphmrs">my SoundCloud page</a>. I also write a bit on <a href="http://medium.com/@brandonlucasgreen">Medium</a> and recently started a blog about creative lifestyle with my girlfriend called <a href="http://tonedeafcolorblind.com">Tone Deaf &amp; Color Blind</a> (I’m the latter, she’s the former).</p><ol start="2"><li>What is your current setup?</li></ol><p>For my day job, I have to use an ugly stock Dell PC desktop, but for everything else in my life, I rely on a 2013 Macbook Pro with retina display running OS X El Capitan.</p><p>I absolutely love this thing’s power and elegance - the 256GB SSD in particular gives me an amazing amount of speed and elegance in doing anything from checking the news to running a 42-track Logic session. I’ve been using it more portably as of late, for commuting between Salem and Boston and getting out of the house on weekends. We have a nice amount of open space and nature in Salem - so I rely heavily on my <a href="http://shop.herschelsupply.com/collections/backpacks/products/little-america-backpack-black-12oz-cotton-canvas">Herschel backpack</a> for keeping my baby safe when I leave the house.</p><p>My girlfriend and I got lucky with a huge two-floor apartment when we moved to Salem, so I was able to put together a little office/music studio on the top floor. In the studio, when I’m at my desk I connect the MBP to an <a href="http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-34UM95-P-ultrawide-monitor">LG UM95 34” ultra-wide monitor</a> which is great for big recording sessions or bigger Trello boards. Most of the furniture in this space is salvaged from previous apartments, but I like what I’ve done with the room for very little extra cash. I built a cheap standing desk out of Ikea parts (some of which have apparently been discontinued), and use this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Built-Monitor-Laptop-Stand-built/dp/B009YQOO8U">old Multiboard stand thing</a> to give the Macbook Pro extra height when standing. (I can push it back conveniently when I want to sit down at a barstool.)</p><p>For more relaxed work, I’ve also got an old <a href="http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S09840535/">Ikea Karlstad loveseat</a> in this room and a 3rd-gen <a href="http://apple.com/tv">Apple TV</a> hooked up to the second UM95 HDMI input, so I can have background TV/music. For listening, I use a pair of <a href="http://www.roland.com/products/ma-15d/">Roland MA-15D</a> monitor speakers, which I got for a really good deal a few years ago and they still sound fantastic to me. They sit on top of a pair of Pyle speaker stands. I use <a href="https://pro.sony.com/bbsc/ssr/product-MDR7506/">Sony MDR-7506</a> headphones for most of my nighttime listening and recording.</p><p>For recording gear, I like to keep as simple and portable as possible. I record through an <a href="https://www.apogeedigital.com/products/duet">Apogee Duet</a> (3rd gen) and I play piano/synths with a <a href="https://www.apogeedigital.com/products/duet">Novation Launchkey</a> (61 keys). I like these items for their easy portability, so I can keep my desk setup consistent with my live performance setup. Behind the Launchkey I have a classic <a href="http://www.shure.com/americas/products/microphones/sm/sm58-vocal-microphone">Shure SM-58</a> with a cheap pop filter for vocal recordings and quick live rehearsals. I play guitar out of a little <a href="http://www.ztamplifiers.com/products/lunchbox.html">ZT Lunchbox</a>, and I play bass out of an old <a href="http://www.musiciansfriend.com/amplifiers-effects/swr-la15-bass-combo-amplifier">SWR LA-15 combo amp</a> that I got back in high school (but it still sounds surprisingly warm for a combo amp). I don’t have very impressive guitars, but I will note my 5-string <a href="http://www.schecterguitars.com/bass/stiletto-studio-5-2013-11-15-detail">Schecter Stiletto studio bass</a>. I absolutely love this thing’s tone and response and will probably never get rid of it.</p><p>For storage, I have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Expansion-Desktop-External-STBV3000100/dp/B00834SJU8">3 TB Seagate Expansion</a> external hard drive for extra storage for old projects, and a separate 2 TB <a href="http://www.apple.com/airport-time-capsule/">Time Capsule</a> which also powers the Wifi in our apartment. My recording projects have started to get bigger as I record more with guitars and less with synths, so the extra space for backups is welcome.</p><p>Elsewhere on my desk, I have a little <a href="http://www.amazon.com/elago-iphones-Smartphones-Support-FaceTime/dp/B002OLM56K">elago m2 iPhone stand</a> (which is surprisingly useful for impromptu Skype/Facetime calls). On the walls, I have a mix of cool prints and art from friends of mine (including a few of my girlfriend’s photographs and giant piece from my old friend <a href="http://tonyhollums.com">Tony Hollums</a>). Finally, a fun little reminder of my foundations: a congratulatory plaque for the release of my <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bushwhack/id263281068">old band’s only album</a>.</p><ol start="3"><li>Where can we find your OS X wallpaper?</li></ol><p>This is actually an image designed by my girlfriend, Alicia Valeri. We took a trip to LA two years ago and she took some great photos during a hike in Griffith Park, which resulted in this cool, hazy treatment.</p><p>You can find the image on <a href="http://laviecreative.co">Alicia’s design &amp; photography site</a>, or purchase a print of it on <a href="https://society6.com/aliciavalericreative">her Society6 store</a>. (Lastly, <a href="http://tonedeafcolorblind.com/wp-content/uploads/LAHaze.jpg">here</a> is a direct link to the wallpaper itself).</p><ol start="4"><li>What software do you use and for what do you use it?</li></ol><p>Generally, I like sticking to Apple’s stock apps where I can (as to avoid clutter - I’m trying to embrace minimalism as a means to reduce distractions in my life). I embrace Apple Mail, Calendar, Safari and Notes for their basic purposes.</p><p><strong>On email, in particular:</strong> I’ve tried so many different email clients - but once I got to Inbox Zero the first time I was able to stick to it without the help of apps like Mailbox and Dispatch. Not having extra apps installed makes me happy and keeps my system cleaner.</p><p>Since I’m a product/project manager by day, I tend to get a bit more detailed when it comes to tasks and projects. I use <a href="http://2doapp.com">2Do</a> for personal tasks &amp; projects, and <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> for anything collaborative. I’ve found the visual, board-based interface of Trello amazing for collaborating with others on music projects, the blog, and for roadmapping full-on apps, so it’s become a major player in my life’s work. (For what it’s worth, I use Trello via the <a href="http://lingsdesigns.com/xccello/">Xccello</a> standalone app with a custom icon.) For personal stuff, I love 2Do - I used stock Reminders for a long time due to Siri input, but then switched to 2Do once I realized I could keep that functionality with much more detail on my tasks.</p><p>Hmm, what else:</p><ul><li><a href="http://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a> for writing long-form stuff (lyrics, product requirements, bigger brainstorms, blog posts, this interview, etc.)</li><li>Apple Notes for simpler reference-like stuff - notes about my health, wish lists, gift ideas for friends, etc. (I absolutely love the Notes share extension in iOS / OS X.)</li><li><a href="http://tapbots.com/tweetbot/mac/">Tweetbot</a> to keep track of Twitter</li><li><a href="http://currentformac.com">Current</a> to keep track of Facebook</li><li><a href="http://reederapp.com/mac/">Reeder 3</a> to keep track of news and writing that I care about.

As much as people hate on iTunes, I actually love that it covers virtually all my listening needs - from quickly importing and reviewing the tracks &amp; demos I’m working on, to maintaining a fairly large music library, to auto-downloading new podcast episodes. With the Macbook Pro’s SSD, it’s surprisingly performant and low-profile on my Mac setup.</p><ol start="5"><li>How would your ideal setup look and function?</li></ol><p>Hardware-wise, I could probably do better in terms of the ergonomics of the desk itself. I’d love for a slightly taller desk or a better solution for more height when standing, because I don’t love the Multiboard thing.</p><p>Software-wise, I’d love for the new Apple Notes to allow for collaboration within notes.

Comedy Bang Bang gets me through long stretches of tedious testing work at the day job.</p><p>In terms of app opens, probably <a href="http://2doapp.com">2Do</a>, since I’m constantly checking what I need to be doing next. A close second and third would be <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> and <a href="http://reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder</a> - I’m constantly jotting down little notes throughout the day that get sorted into various places (mostly <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a>, <a href="http://2doapp.com">2Do</a> and Notes), and I’ve got a bad habit of constantly checking for news updates. I’m proud to say that I’ve weened myself off social updates on my phone, but not quite blogs/news yet.</p><p>I keep in touch with people via 3 applications, mainly: Messages/iMessage (for friends/family), <a href="http://hangouts.google.com">Hangouts</a> (also for close friends &amp; colleagues) and <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> (for work projects). I keep the Phone app in my dock mostly for emergencies and frequent contacts (read: girlfriend), but it’s certainly not the most common means of communication I use.</p><p>I also spend a lot of my daily commutes reading via both <a href="http://www.apple.com/ibooks/">iBooks</a> and the aforementioned Reeder, both of which look great on the giant 6 Plus screen (and sort of rendered my iPad unnecessary for daily use). I use <a href="http://readability.com">Readability</a>’s share extension to easily save articles for later, which then pop up instantly in Reeder. I have a big Entertainment folder of other apps for occasional fun (Hulu, Netflix, Product Hunt, Medium, etc.) I sometimes use <a href="http://apps.wordpress.com">Wordpress</a> and <a href="http://panic.com/coda">Coda</a> for iOS to quickly check on my websites, fix bugs or review occasional comments.</p><p>I occasionally tinker with music on my iPhone, too. I usually use the Voice Memos app to quickly take down song ideas &amp; melodies for later. I also experiment a bit on the go using <a href="http://loopyapp.com">Loopy</a>, <a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/garageband/">Garageband</a>, <a href="http://fingerlab.net/portfolio/dm1">DM1</a> and Propellerheads’ <a href="https://www.propellerheads.se/figure">Figure</a>. I also have started to play around with <a href="http://periscope.tv">Periscope</a> to live-broadcast piano jams.</p><p>I’ve started to embrace the iPhone as a means of keeping myself healthy and sane. I love <a href="http://www.sleepcycle.com">Sleep Cycle</a> as an alarm clock and sleep monitor. I love <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/steps-pedometer-step-counter/id708359518?mt=8">Steps</a> as a basic pedometer and reminder to stay active. I’ve been looking for a more in-depth dashboard/insights app but haven’t picked one yet. Alicia and I are foodies, and we use <a href="http://opentable.com">OpenTable</a> regularly to plan dates.</p><p>For more boring daily stuff, I’m constantly checking my finances with <a href="http://mint.com">Mint</a>, keeping track of Prime purchases with the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/amazon-app-shop-browse-scan/id297606951?mt=8">Amazon</a> app, and scanning receipts in an attempt at paperless-ness with <a href="https://readdle.com/products/scannerpro">Scanner Pro</a>. I rely on Copyfeed to share text across my devices and <a href="http://agilebits.com/1password">1Password</a> both for accessing my accounts and two-factor authentication (hoping for a 2fa shortcut or Today widget sometime!!!). I also use stock Mail, Calendar, Safari and Notes for daily email, appointments, web browsing and basic note storage.</p><ol start="5"><li>Which app could you not live without?</li></ol><p>This is kind of a stupid answer, but (Apple) Music.

The UX is somewhat crap (not denying this) and the positioning is unclear (also not denying this). I’m sure Apple will work on this over time, but it’s hard to convert users if they start off with a bad first impression (hey, iTunes Ping / Tidal / any other music network that fails to catch on).</p><p>But we shouldn’t be surprised that Apple Music Connect is adopting slowly. For major artists, their labels (or the artists themselves) have already bought into another streaming service - most of the majors into Spotify, and the dozen-or-so upper-echelon folks who co-sponsored Tidal - so why should we expect them to suddenly release a single on Apple Music Connect for the sake of their fans? Fans by nature are rabid, so they’ll follow you to whichever network you choose (this is why Tidal didn’t die on arrival). What’s the incentive for Kanye West to post his new stuff on Apple Music?</p><p>SoundCloud is in a weird spot in that it has the adoption of millions (including Europe and Asia, perhaps most importantly), but isn’t necessarily tied directly to labels. In other words, there’s no incentive for Kanye West to NOT post new music on SoundCloud - no conflict of interest, no problem. That said, the network’s moves to partner with brands is probably causing other strings to pull artists toward it. The general public will probably never know the full scope of it, but it’s worth assuming that major artists are probably picking their music networks of choice <strong>very</strong> strategically.</p><p>But Apple Music (and more specifically, Connect) is not going to pick up like this, with the exception of a few possible artists with existing partnerships with Apple (read: Trent Reznor, Dr. Dre, Adele &amp; Coldplay)<span data-nosnippet=""><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">3</a></sup></span>. And I’m fine with that: it’s not done. Apple admitted that <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/03/apple-music-improve-festival-streaming">they still have work to do</a>. Anyone who’s tried to build or work at a startup knows the difficulty in launching a good MVP quickly. While we instinctively seem to hold Apple to a higher standard given their massive stack of cash, you can’t blame them for putting out a brand-new streaming music service and wanting to iterate &amp; experiment. I’ll be a contrarian: I love the idea of integrating streaming &amp; social music discovery within the existing music player. <strong>Why not talk about music in the same app that you listen to music?</strong> Sure, it may look cluttered due to “bad UX” and purposeless due to low adoption, but it’s an interesting approach at trying to bring the relationship between artist and listener closer to the music itself that establishes that relationship in the first place. That’s a pretty massive and difficult concept to get right, so I can’t be surprised that it’s a little messy the first go-around.</p><p>Any new, minimum-viable product requires iteration and experimentation. No matter what they say in PR announcements, Apple has to be trying to experiment with Connect. You can’t write a music product off immediately when artists don’t flock to it immediately; great things take time to get right.</p><h1 id="earthside-reinvigorated-prog-and-reminded-me-of-my-roots">Earthside reinvigorated prog, and reminded me of my roots</h1><h2 id="music-that-challenged-me-in-2015-part-two">Music that challenged me in 2015, part two</h2><p><em>As part of my reflection on the music that inspired me in 2015, I started writing a bit about those albums and songs that will largely be overlooked by Big Music - but are still ambitious, challenging and exceedingly interesting.

But regardless of what genre or why, you put music on in the background to feel something.</p><p>TLDR: If you want to not just feel something, but feel it with a level of intensity you might not have before while listening to music, you should listen to <em>A Dream in Static</em> by Earthside.</p><p>I grew up listening to mostly angry music. My parents didn’t push this upon me - in fact, they didn’t really make me angry at all or neglect me or listen to any angry music themselves - all I had was radio and my MTV. I distinctly remember the first time I saw the video for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8Xb_7YDroQ">Eve 6’s “Inside Out”</a> and having the silly cathartic moment that every young boy feels when he first witnesses <strong>ANGST</strong>. I started headbanging. I was then running around my parents’ living room, not dancing, but slamming my feet into the ground, punching the air in miserable joy. I wasn’t a sad or angry kid, but I think this (and a few other songs) stuck with me in such a way that dark and angry music resonated with me more so than any other.</p><p>When I first heard Tool’s “Schism” in 2001, I had a similar standout moment - the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhjG47gtMCo">video</a>, but more importantly the music, shocked me. Rock music could not only let me express my (misplaced) anger, but also make me feel awe, dread, all those existential feelings I had never experienced to that point at the ripe young age of 12. It was shortly after this that I learned that Tool was of a group of largely uncategorizable heavy bands, but usually pigeonholed into the genre of “progressive metal” - an overly generalized term for bands who skirt the norms of time &amp; key signature, focus on big topics &amp; bigger sound, and have small but <em>extremely</em> rabid fanbases. I became one of those rabid fans - first of Tool, then of Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, Ayreon, Opeth and various others. I shared this with my dad who then exposed me to Yes, Pink Floyd and King Crimson, and I became obsessed. I HAD to learn everything about every song, how they all connected, what bizarre alternate realities the songs existed within, how the <a href="https://www.fibonicci.com/fibonacci/tool-lateralus/">time signatures within a song related to the purpose of the song itself</a>.</p><p>In 2004 I picked up bass guitar and, shortly thereafter, joined a band in high school bent on making powerfully emotive and complex music to try and channel this fascination into something productive. But because we were nerdy teens from suburban Connecticut, we didn’t have a whole lot of actual hardship to channel into powerfully emotive music. Plus, none of us were confident in our ability to write lyrics - so we made dark, edgy, self-indulgent instrumentals with silly names like “Mariachi Massacre” and “The Greatest Wall.” But it was a hell of a lot of fun - and we <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bushwhack/id263281068">made some fairly cool music</a> for a bunch of weird teenagers from Connecticut.</p><p>Then I went to college, started drinking, got a girlfriend, and landed my first internship - which happened to be in <a href="http://sonicbids.com">both the music &amp; tech industry</a>. I was around tons of other musical tastes and quickly got tired of the pretentiousness of prog metal. It just wasn’t vibing anymore, man. So I quit that band in late 2008 and tried my hand at some other stuff: a Talking Heads cover band, playing lead guitar in a stoner rock band, trying my hand at <a href="http://soundcloud.com/sphmrs">writing alone</a> and with other people. To my old band, I said that I didn’t want to write music like that anymore and could not endure the impossible uphill battle that is trying to achieve noteworthiness as a prog metal musician. My tech career was more lucrative and important.</p><h2 id="in-2014-that-band-publicly-became-earthside">In 2014, that band publicly became <a href="http://earthsideband.com">Earthside</a>.</h2><p>I remember a few years earlier when Jamie (Earthside guitarist and one of my closest friends to this day) sent me a rough cut of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL_v5U2AeIs">“The Closest I’ve Come,”</a> a sprawling instrumental track that I had learned a few years prior when they asked me to fill in on bass for a show. They had finally locked down a permanent bassist in Ryan Griffin and tightened up the composition to the point where it was release-ready. I remember being impressed by my former comrades - an appropriate development of the initial sound we had established as Bushwhack, more focused, “cinematic” and, most importantly, nuanced. There is a specific breakdown roughly 6 minutes into the song in which all instruments abruptly pause - except for a quiet, ominous arpeggiating keyboard line that wisps you out of riffs and into a floating sensation. The guitar levitates with you, occasionally supplementing the keyboards with subtle harmonic feedback. It’s as if you’re being slowly pulled upward toward the cosmos - until drums, bass and guitars suddenly shatter a glass ceiling above you and push you back down to the ground with the most brutal rhythm of the song thus far.</p><p>To say that this was representative of the scope of the album they were working on is a gross understatement. Jamie had mentioned they were toying with the idea of guest vocalists, researching string quartets and small orchestras to record with and some producer in Sweden I hadn’t heard of. I largely disregarded all of this - where did they have the money to pull all that off? I certainly didn’t, and I was the one with the lucrative tech career.</p><p>But after over almost 7 years of hard work, Earthside finally released a true debut - an 8-track, hour-plus-long catharsis of a debut. It’s sometimes a difficult listen: it’s brutal, it’s morose, it’s jagged and it’s exceedingly triumphant, sometimes all in one track. It begins with the aforementioned “The Closest I’ve Come” as a hint of the journey this album takes, which in the band’s words encapsulates <a href="https://earthside.bandcamp.com">“everything we are as human beings”</a> - which isn’t wrong.</p><p>See, the thing with <em>A Dream in Static</em> is that, while it occasionally uses prog-metal clichés in its song titles and lyrics (eg. all the self-actualization stuff, the song title “Entering the Light”), it makes the rare achievement of actually embodying those emotions and ideas in full. “Entering the Light” makes you feel like you’re actually marching toward said light, and then when all instruments are distant except for a quiet string harmony, you feel as if you’ve finally made it - only to discover you’re back where you started, marching again. I haven’t heard another rock song (let alone an instrumental!) that made me contemplate my own mortality like this in years. The scale of this album is enormous, and that’s ignoring the fact that these are still my nerdy friends from high school. Every single performance of every single idea is executed flawlessly - technically near-perfect but still human at its core.</p><p>Let’s talk about the 10-minute “single,” “Mob Mentality” - if any song attempts to represent the absurd mess of the state of our country right now, this could be the song that does it. (Ironically, it was recorded in Sweden.) I know this song is deeply personal to Jamie, as he wrote it both as a senior college thesis and as a means to deal with his own confusion of his life’s next steps, in a world where influencers are complicating your own worldview more than ever. Who has any idea what the <em>hell</em> is going on in their own lives and what’s going to happen next? And better yet, how is the persistent influence of others making that anxiety any less overwhelming? The sheer scale that the Moscow Symphony Orchestra and Lajon Witherspoon’s <span data-nosnippet=""><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">4</a></sup></span> performances bring to this workout of a piece is daunting, but also intensely relatable and satisfying.</p><p>There are three key breaks in the piece that make the song work. The first, a deliberate breath of curious air; the second, a sudden dip into playful terror as Lajon sings “and I pray for you to see / I’ve been sheltered by my bliss”. The last break of note occurs with only about 40 seconds remaining, after the song’s final climax has already been hit - it’s the song’s “Oh shit!” moment as the band takes you back to the original melodic idea that began this ride.</p><h2 id="oh-and-this-is-the-second-track-on-the-album">Oh, and this is the second track on the album.</h2><p>There is no particular secret sauce to a progressive rock or metal record; some songwriters devise a complex storyline or overarching concept which may be explored lyrically or within the musical structure itself. However, much of “prog” has fallen into one of two traps: it either falls back on past tropes and stereotypes and, in the process, loses originality and/or emotional weight; or it gets so tightly fused into other genres of music that it’s barely noticeable (read: the first two Coheed &amp; Cambria albums, which I still find excellent). When I was playing prog metal in Bushwhack, we were intensely aware of those tropes - as well as tropes in other styles of music - and tried to turn them upside down and meld them together into odd results. Over time it became less about fun genre-shifting for our own amusement and more about actively trying to bring complex (yet sometimes competing) ideas and finding some kind of emotional synergy. I’m happy that this band continued down this path.</p><p>“Skyline” (track 5) probably contains this year’s most awe-inspiring musical idea. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LjYvwptUWU">As the band explains</a>, about seven minutes in, the song follows 3 rhythmically competing lines (on piano, drums and lead guitar) for nearly a minute, winding around each other like synchronized birds in flight. Then suddenly they all meet and come into rhythmic unison in one of the most joyful, cathartic, nearly orgasmic musical expressions of cosmic scale I’ve heard. Even before this moment, this song dazzles: the song begins with a sudden thud after the quiet march of previous track “Entering the Light” and, after a brief introductory theme, breaks into my 2nd favorite bass line of the year (sorry guys - “King Kunta” wins this one).</p><p>Structurally, this album is half vocal tracks and half instrumentals, but each track contains at least one satisfying surprise. The title track, which features Tesseract’s Daniel Tompkins on lead vocals, seems unassuming at first - until its first chorus. I have not heard a more intensely joyful vocal performance in prog than Daniel’s in this song. “Ungrounding” is the one instrumental I haven’t mentioned yet, and while it seems fairly straightforward technical metal at first, there are two elements of this track that once again demonstrate the mastery of composition this band has. First: Frank (keyboardist)’s melodic line - out of context, it honestly sounds like it was lifted from a trance or hip hop track. It’s this fast-moving airy synth that almost works an attempted homage to Lil Wayne’s “Lollipop”. But once placed against the rhythmic complexity of “Ungrounding”, it takes on a whole new character that embraces chaos - what was once intended to put its listeners into a trance has now run amok.</p><p>Second: What the first half of “Ungrounding” does to inspire chaos, the second half does to make sense of it. There are feelings of grief, rage and outright fatigue (paired with a downtempo, down-octave version of the original synth melody). I remember first listening to this song and not expecting much beyond the first minute or two, but the second half pulls you back in with force - a testament to Earthside’s ability to truly capture attention and tap into the deepest reaches of your psyche.</p><p>The album closes with “Contemplation of the Beautiful,” a nearly-12-minute brooding funeral march; one could argue that it refers to the previous 7 tracks just as much as its subject’s waning sense of self. <em>A Dream in Static</em> does encompass everything we are as human, from the wonder of birth to inevitable death. Its ability to traverse tough, complex emotional ground with focus &amp; grace, and it’s affected the music I find inspiring and even how I approach writing music. It tells a story through music more vividly than most concept albums I’ve heard and has reinvigorated my interest in metal &amp; prog, and I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone who genuinely wants to feel their emotions heightened by sound.</p><p>But more importantly, my friends made this record. Friends whom I have a history with making music and I left to pursue my own path. Part of me wants to be jealous, to question my decisions to pursue tech and solo songwriting; but a much bigger part of me is proud and amazed at these guys. They gave me a reason to once again appreciate my musical foundations and our time together as a band. If anyone reads this and happens to have a friend in a band, I encourage you to give that band an honest listen - they might just surprise you with something great.</p><h1 id="amazing-free-mac-apps-for-tech-averse-creatives">Amazing, free Mac apps for tech-averse creatives</h1><p>I rely on technology (ie. a bunch of apps on my iPhone and MacBook) to keep myself in order: tools to create actionable tasks, collaborate on projects, speed up my workflow, and probably more things I could list if I took a look at my phone.</p><p>Alicia doesn’t like this stuff. I try to push apps on her constantly to try - since they’ll totally make her life so much better!!! - but my efforts have thus far mostly been fruitless.

I’m really bummed about it. I’ve had some really good friends rave about how life-changing his shows are, and I kept convincing myself that I’d actually go to one. That can’t happen anymore, and it reminds me to take advantage of what exists in the now as much as I can.</p><p>What I have now is his entire discography, pulled together from various sources since I started listening to Prince regularly in my adult life.<span data-nosnippet=""><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup></span> This past week I’ve been listening almost exclusively to all the Prince music I’ve collected, while also occasionally reading the reflective writing that has been published about the Artist. Much of that writing has been focused around his early-era, groundbreaking synth pop work: <em>Purple Rain</em>, working with The Revolution, the song “1999”. An occasional word about his tenuous relationship Warner Bros. Records. <a href="https://apple.news/AeFIWROwtN02lKOrY7rfG8Q">This great piece</a> about the underrated &amp; sometimes bizarre 1981 release <em>Controversy.</em></p><h2 id="i-want-to-talk-about-one-prince-song-in-particular-that-fundamentally-changed-how-i-think-about-recorded-music-the-ballad-of-dorothy-parker">I want to talk about one Prince song in particular that fundamentally changed how I think about recorded music: <strong>“The Ballad of Dorothy Parker.”</strong></h2><p>I didn’t like <em>Purple Rain</em> the first time I heard it in full. That was back in 2009 or so.<span data-nosnippet=""><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup></span> It was so 80s. So many synth sounds. It didn’t really hit me that “When Doves Cry” had no bassline, and what that meant for music at the time, until I read about it in some retrospective a year or two later.</p><p>The album that sucked me into the Artist’s oeuvre was instead <em>Sign O’ The Times</em>, which a close friend of mine recommended in 2010 or so. It’s also considered one of his classics, but it’s a weird one: it’s a double album, and while all of Prince’s albums meld all sorts of genres together, this one frequently put wildly contrasting material against itself, back-to-back, almost forcing the listener to fundamentally change listening habits every few minutes. Take “Slow Love” and “Hot Thing,” both on disc 1 - the former is a great albeit typical sexy Prince slow jam, the latter almost a new standard for extreme pop minimalism. The entire first two minutes of “Hot Thing” pretty much center around F# and a drum machine and don’t change until a bizarre (for Prince) sax solo and frenetic scat-like vocals dominate the mix.</p><p>“The Ballad of Dorothy Parker” sits at the end of the first side of disc 1 of <em>Sign O’ The Times</em>, as sort of an ominous closer to a side full of likely hits. The title track was an actual hit; “Play In The Sunshine” is one of the most uplifting and energetic songs released in the 80s; “Housequake” is, despite its strange pitch-shifted lead vocal, an undeniably funky party jam. “Dorothy Parker” almost serves as the hangover after the housequake - it’s barely a ballad, with its frenetic beats and brisk tempo, but it paints a hazy, bleak picture of Prince’s after-party vulnerability.</p><p>Susan Rogers, Prince’s sound engineer during this period, recalled in <a href="http://daddyrockstar.tumblr.com/post/44079621006/susan-rogers-on-princes-sign-o-the-times-part-2">a wonderfully detailed interview</a> that a new recording console at Paisley Park (Prince’s recording studio complex) was not wired up properly when he impulsively decided to begin recording “Dorothy Parker”, and noticed that everything he recorded was coming out dull - no high end, no typical sheen. Prince noticed instantly, but decided he loved it given the fact that he conceived the whole song in a dream, and the dull sound complemented that dream-like quality of the lyrics he wrote.</p><p>How does the dream begin? Fuzzy and abruptly, as many do. “Dorothy Parker,” the recording, kicks off instantly with a sped-up drum fill, then silence, then an ambiguous 7th chord that takes a few seconds to resolve to E minor. In fact, every section of the song begins in suspension - when it’s not pivoting to a different tonal space entirely, Prince relies on A7s and F9s to leave you needing resolution, which doe</p><p>What I love about the “Dorothy Parker” recording is how dirty it sounds throughout. Not dirty in the typically-sexy way that Prince usually injects into all his work - but <strong>tarnished</strong>, ugly, weak in repair. The 3 drum machine rhythms that drive the song forward constantly interrupt each other; the bass is hard to identify as synthesized or performed; the chords performed through a weak-sounding tremolo. Every element of the music sounds like it’s falling apart, pushing up against each other, fucking up left and right, and Prince is trying to corral all the pieces together via his story to tell.</p><p>The story, by the way, is also brilliantly ugly in its detail: Dorothy was a waitress on the promenade, working the night shift for a lotta tips. She hooks up with Prince in the form of a shared bath after ordering a fruit cocktail (who does that?) because he ain’t <em>too</em> hungry. There are numerous references to clothes being wet (which is uncomfortable for anyone), keeping his pants on (almost a first for Prince), a violent room. In the climax Dorothy comforts the Artist with Joni Mitchell so he can return to said room. It’s a song about vulnerability in every respect: being uncomfortable, revealing yourself, letting someone in. That’s all a stumbling mess most of the time in reality - not unlike this song’s rhythm section - it takes a lot to say “cool” to a new face, and it’s weirdly specific to ask to keep your pants on in a presumably sexual encounter. Perhaps this was Prince telling us that he wasn’t this perfect sexual being he portrayed in the rest of his material. Who knows.</p><p>Prince apparently didn’t know at the time he wrote “The Ballad of Dorothy Parker” that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Parker">she was also a writer;</a> to me, that discrepancy only adds to the confusing dream the song puts forth. Are these the same women? Is Dorothy a waitress who moonlights as a writer? Does she become a writer after being inspired by the Artist’s violent room experience? Who is this girl, really? In the way that <em>Breaking Bad</em> fans clamored to learn more about the ugly, tragic story of Walter White, I get wrapped up in the story of Prince and Dorothy every time I play this track. <strong>If this song taught me anything, it’s that a song does not need to sound polished in order to be great.</strong><span data-nosnippet=""><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup></span></p><p>The production value (or lack thereof?) gives the song its identity, no doubt. Of course, however, it’s not as easy to replicate that sound in a live setting - while I hadn’t seen Prince perform live during his life, I’ve seen only one video of him performing “Dorothy Parker” with his band. I think it was on the Arsenio Hall show. In the live setting, the song transforms into a Latin-infused mid-tempo R&amp;B jam; a salsa-esque saxophone hook brings a sense of direction more than anything in the recording. As great as this live performance is, the emotional center of the song is fundamentally different than its recorded counterpart. Dorothy is still a waitress, but Prince talks to her with a more confident strut.</p><p>Perhaps my own social awkwardness is why I identify with the recorded “Dorothy Parker” so much; I would never approach someone with that confidence in public. The bleakness of the recording resembles the murky reality of meeting new people: everyone has their baggage, and it’s really uncomfortable and sometimes requires a vulnerability you’re not used to bearing. That vulnerability is lost in most popular music; some artists might explore it in their lyrics, but there are few examples where the music and its production take the listener to a place beyond the words themselves. Few examples in pop this ugly.</p><p>Let’s hope for more songs like “Dorothy Parker.”</p><p>I spend a lot of time trying to be more productive in my work. This is less of an issue in terms of actually getting things done, but more an issue of getting <em>the right</em> things done first - and relentlessly staying obsessively organized. Of course, it takes time to figure out the right things to work on, and sometimes I blow a ton of time figuring that out - so I need a good solution to help me with that.</p><p>In doing so, I then waste a lot of trying to optimize my own system for project management. The amount of articles and opinions on how to optimize your productivity is absurd; it really comes down to what works best for you. I’ve found a system that seems to work for me.</p><ol><li>I rely way too much on reminders via Siri, and like having those as part of the full list of things I need to do.</li><li>I like the clean UI of iOS8/Yosemite, and most non-Apple apps force other UI conventions on you that may or may not complement OSX/iOS nicely.</li><li>Evernote is great for self-project managing, when there’s a lot of notes to be kept in the background. I use its Reminders feature less as a tool for actual reminders, and more as a running list of active projects I have going on. (The individual tasks of those projects, however, usually end up as a messy checklist in the Evernote note or in my reminders somewhere else - annoying.)</li><li>Collaborative projects are managed in Trello - no exceptions at this point. It’s become my favorite, simplest way of manage everything from technical projects, album releases, to this blog.</li><li>I like the ability to share lists (say, with Alicia or my parents) - which virtually every task management app offers. Wunderlist prides itself on this, but realistically I’m not finding myself collaborating with a ton of people on lists. I find Trello much stronger for true collaboration, but weak on task list management. The stock Apple Reminders gets the job done for, say, sharing a grocery list.</li><li>I don’t like having to manage multiple apps/platforms for essentially the same thing. In other words, the less apps I need to pay attention to, the better.</li></ol><p>So I discovered GoodTask (<a href="http://goodtaskapp.com">http://goodtaskapp.com</a>), which essentially layers over Apple’s Reminders and gives me the features and flexibility that Apple didn’t build themselves. It can either fully replace Reminders, or act as a more elaborate version of Reminders for involved project management, depending on your need. There’s a few minor quirks (including some rare crashing), and it’s not free ($20 for desktop, $5 for iOS) - but no monthly subscription and no juggling multiple platforms. This seems to have made my setup work:</p><ul><li>All reminders, project-related tasks and lists are in GoodTask (via Reminders)</li><li>All new tasks are stored in an Inbox list, and then delegated to Home, Work, Creative or Reminders (for things I really don’t care about until I’m reminded)</li><li>Tasks related to collaborative work (ie. things that colleagues need to know about) stay in Trello. All tasks that are personal to me stay in GoodTask/Reminders. For instance, if I have to wireframe something that needs peer or client review, that stays in the UX Trello board for that client, with me as the assignee and a published due date.<ul><li>I may create a separate reminder in GoodTask so I remember to start work the week prior, but that’s personal to me.</li></ul></li><li>Special lists for certain things I put together on a constant basis (ie. Groceries)</li><li>Every big project, app or client gets a smart hashtag in GoodTask, which corresponds to a catch-all project note in Evernote</li><li>All !!!-level tasks in GoodTask show up in an “important” smart list</li></ul><p>This seems to be working well for me - that is, until a new app comes out that I feel compelled to try.</p><h1 id="nyc-and-back-permanently">NYC and back (permanently)</h1><p>I realized that the happiest people in New York City are bartenders. They are decently paid, have flexible hours, can usually find work right near home, and pride themselves on being a friendly savior to those who so desperately need their service at the end of another punishing day. Those people, pretty much every other resident of NYC, is either miserable, tired or both. Even the rich ones.</p><p>NYC is great if you can embrace chaos, the kind of chaos where as soon as you leave your house you’re wondering how long it’ll take before you get hit in the face by something or someone, metaphorically or physically. It’s terrifyingly unpredictable and we found it difficult (at best) to enjoy much of anything, let alone exercising any free will or creativity. We went to dance parties because peer pressure. We went to dinner because we needed to get out of our (admittedly well-decorated) railroad car of an apartment. I performed in NYC…playing bass behind a house DJ (my friend Rich, he’s actually a really good house producer) shoved into a corner because the club needed to make room for more people to dance - far from my ideal gig.</p><p>Sometime in April Alicia was really worked up about some job prospect and I told her:</p><p>“You know, you don’t NEED to look for jobs in New York, in case something cool comes up somewhere else.”</p><p>The joy on her face when she looked up was something I hadn’t seen in months. We started rattling off companies, positions, cities…suddenly MA was back in the cards.</p><p>She started tearing up. For me, being close to family was nice but not a priority; for her, it was the reassurance that everything could turn out OK. If we found a place just north of Boston, we could work in and outside the city and be 30 minutes or less from parents, siblings, best friends. A work opportunity came up. Then 2 friends got engaged, another pregnant - Alicia suddenly had photography gigs. Only 1 of those, as a glorified intern shooter, actually panned out.</p><p>In June I got a job offer through some weird circumstances, with the caveat that I’d have to work on-site in Boston. The timing worked, and we were out by July. We looked around for a place for a bit; with very little effort we found a HUGE duplex right near Salem Common. 2 minutes to walk to a huge park; walk 2 minutes in the other direction and you’re at a cute little beach. It’s not even far from the city compared to how far away everything is from Ridgewood, Queens.</p><p>So we came here, and we’re both happy again.</p><h1 id="so-whats-salem-like-for-a-bunch-of-young-creative-professionals">So what’s Salem like for a bunch of young creative professionals?</h1><p>I never thought it would affect me that much, but the prevalence of nature has really started to inspire both of us. We both love going outside again - I’ve got my Zoom H4 unpacked and for the first time in almost 2 years I’m excited to record the sounds around me. Alicia’s started to take pictures just for the sake of taking pictures. We’re eating healthy. (We can afford to again, thanks Market Basket.) We have space in our apartment to fully realize our creative ideas without stepping all over each other.</p><p>How is it in town? You know how everyone says that Bostonians are mean, sort of like New Yorkers but with a harsher accent and a perverse love of their sports team? Salem residents couldn’t be further from that stereotype - everyone is amazingly nice, humble, inviting. I really think that part of the inspiration of all Brooklyn musicians is their interactions with the city’s chaotic meanness (which coincidentally is what’s causing the homogenization of Brooklyn music, since the chaos is becoming so materialistic and almost predictable); in Salem, we’re being inspired by the town’s whimsy and warmth.</p><p>So instead of starting a blog and not touching it for months, we’ll have more to post as a result.</p><h2 id="the-compulsive-process">The compulsive process</h2><p>Every day when I get home from work, I walk in the door, kiss my girlfriend Alicia and start organizing things. If it’s Monday, I take the trash and recycling out to the street and line up all our bins neatly in a row. Otherwise I put my keys on the hook, my wallet &amp; sunglasses in a tray next to said hook, pick up the small pile of bags, jackets and/or shoes that Alicia leaves by the door and put each item in its respective closet or corner; then as she starts cooking I tidy up the non-junk mail we received that day, throw the rest into recycling, wash my coffee mug out in the sink, wash her mug out, review the state of the dishwasher. Next I’m washing dishes as she uses them to cook our dinner; it looks like a Charlie Chaplin assembly line if we have the right background music playing.</p><p>We eat. Sometimes in front of the TV, sometimes at our brand-new first-owned dining table. I compulsively pick up the dishes to go wash them, sometimes regrettably before she’s even done eating her dinner. The dishwasher is full, so I might as well run it. The laundry hamper is full, and I’m getting low on t-shirts to wear to work - should probably do a load.</p><p>By the time I start relaxing, it’s either too late to play any music (might wake up the neighbors) or I burnt myself out just tidying up the place. But for me, having control over my house grants me the calm I need to relax &amp; think creatively. It’s not obsessive-compulsive (maybe it is? Who knows/cares); but it’s a mental exercise that keeps me proud of what I’ve got around me. Most of us go through days (even weekends) without thinking much at all - at work, at social events (which take less thought than the decision whether to even go), even when trying to write something (yeah, that’s a stab at lazy blogging conventions, so what?).</p><p>For a long time I tried to force creativity, dedicating whole evenings in front of a MIDI keyboard trying to compose - but instead of writing any great melodies, I ended up lazily repeating the same riff I’d written years prior over and over for 3 hours with nothing new or different. My head was in the wrong space during those forced moments; obsessively organizing my home life seems to correct that. I’ve learned to love the process, even though it’s sort of compulsive by now.</p><p>Also, Alicia loves not having to do dishes or laundry, so win-win.</p><h2 id="exploiting-the-hour-commute">Exploiting the hour commute</h2><p>Every weekday morning I commute from Salem Common to Boston’s Back Bay, which takes roughly 1 hour and 5 minutes. This involves: a 10-minute walk; a 26-to-33-minute ride on the MBTA Commuter Rail, Newburyport/Rockport line; a zero-to-20-minute-wait for an Orange line subway train, depending on the presence of a disabled train or mechanical failure or track fire or signal problem or good old rushed idiots crossing the yellow line; then a 10-15 minute Orange line subway ride into Back Bay Station. And I still haven’t gotten to my desk yet. A lot of sitting, a lot of waiting.</p><p>I initially didn’t really care about that – most NYC subway rides are pretty long if you live in the outer boroughs – but after starting my new gig at Wayfair, I got bummed pretty quickly about the amount of time wasted sitting and waiting. Plus, anyone who knows anything about the MBTA subway &amp; commuter rail systems knows that they are frustrating at best, and at worst completely non-functioning and apathetic to public need.</p><p>But I didn’t want to move any closer to the city; there was a reason we decided to live one block from the water in a relatively sleepy town. So I pushed myself to make the best of the situation and have ended up pleasantly surprised with the results.</p><ol><li><strong>I started reading during the waiting and standing parts.</strong> While in NYC I started reading more on Medium, saving articles to Pocket, and generally feeling more informed about the world thanks to lots of time spent on subways between Queens and Manhattan. When I realized I would be spending ~10 hours of each week commuting, I had a perfect excuse to start reading David Foster Wallace’s <em>Infinite Jest</em>. It took me two months, but I finished it.</li><li><strong>I started writing (or continue reading) during the sitting-down parts.</strong> I wasn’t really able to start centralizing my thoughts for Tone Deaf &amp; Color Blind, or a few of the other ideas I’ve had (details tba) until I had 2 hours of free time each day during my commuting. (Finishing <em>Infinite Jest</em> also helped give me some inspiration to write, so thanks MBTA for giving me the time to finish that.)</li><li><strong>Optional: brought a Nintendo 3DS for the ride.</strong> Nintendo’s best games for the 3DS are objectively more immersive than virtually any game in the iOS app store. (The only real exceptions here are iOS ports of previous releases, like the Final Fantasy games.) Instead of mindlessly catapulting birds at pigs, try dipping into the compelling story of Bravely Default – which really messes with you about halfway through – or solving some surprisingly complex puzzles in Hyrule as Link. I finished games I had left half-finished for months.</li></ol><h2 id="task-managers-are-tough">Task managers are tough</h2><p>Wunderlist, Trello, Todoist, OmniFocus. 2do. Things. I have to imagine that most smartphone users haven’t even heard of these apps. That’s probably why there’s such an apparent subculture around each one. The average person will never break into the most beloved apps, and those who do will defend it to no end.</p><p>So why don’t so many people, who presumably have things they need to do in their lives, use one of these tools? For all the people that <em>do</em> try a project management tool, why do so many underutilize them?</p><p>Everyone has a smartphone, and most of them probably use stock functionality (read: Reminders &amp; Calendar) to keep track of their daily lives on that smartphone. However, <strong>Reminders rarely has accountability</strong> - what if you forget to set a reminder time? What if you miss the location-specific notification by the time you’ve left? What if some to-dos are dependent on others and you can’t check them off the list until some other thing you neglected gets done?</p><p>Are the to-dos I’m getting reminded about even a good use of my time right now? What about the big important complicated things I want to do? How do I even break those things down into the little to-dos to put in my list? What does that mean to me in the big picture?</p><p>The average person doesn’t want to (and almost certainly can’t) think through all that stuff, even though they potentially have implications on their daily lives.</p><p>This conundrum, in the workplace, is basically why project and product managers exist. Product managers help to figure out the right things to focus on and why; project managers make sure they happen so you, Mr. Stakeholder Guy don’t have to worry about all the little details.</p><p>Personal assistant apps exist, <a href="http://appcrawlr.com/ios-apps/best-apps-virtual-assistant">even virtual ones</a>, to remind you of upcoming meetings and tasks - so why haven’t we developed a “personal product manager” that takes your big goals in life and helps you break them down and focus on the most achievable pieces of said goal?</p><p>I think about the big things that I want to eventually do in my life - get married, build a company, buy a house, be a notable musician, other things - there’s a <strong>ton of knowledge</strong> of what to do to make those things happen on the Internet. But parsing all that information is a nightmare - you’re basically relegated to Google searching or starting with blogs/resources you trust and vetting the content endlessly until you end up with a series of tasks, which may or may not be in order, prioritized or even possible. Then, you have friends and/or family as a resource, which may contradict your online findings (or even each other). I don’t even want to think about the difference between my dad’s opinion on starting a business compared to my previous employer.</p><p>Productivity apps can’t do this thinking; it’s not what they’re designed to do. 2do, one of my favorites, requires a whole lot of task creation and organization in order to be truly useful. and <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5989980/ive-been-using-evernote-all-wrong-heres-why-its-actually-amazing?utm_expid=66866090-62.H_y_0o51QhmMY_tue7bevQ.0&amp;utm_referrer=http://lifehacker.com/5989980/ive-been-using-evernote-all-wrong-heres-why-its-actually-amazing">People have said that about Evernote</a>, too. Trello is great for visualizing projects in a board format, but it doesn’t tell you what should populate that board and what of that stuff needs to get done in order to make BIG AMAZING GOAL X happen. (That’s probably why they’ve started collecting and sharing <a href="https://trello.com/inspiration">sample boards for various use cases</a>.) The thought process around focusing the idea into discrete pieces hasn’t been productized for personal lives.</p><p>I wonder if this is why productivity apps aren’t ubiquitous - because they exist to humor the details of lives instead of boiling them down to what’s important.</p><h1 id="postlight-instagram-revenue-growth-potential">Postlight: Instagram revenue growth potential</h1><h2 id="summary">Summary</h2><p>Instagram primarily generates revenue via sponsored and branded content disseminated through its platform. Its advertising arm, Instagram For Business, integrates deeply into the Instagram app experience.</p><p>According to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3029395/bottom-line/how-the-most-successful-brands-dominate-instagram-and-you-can-too">a 2014 Fast Company article</a>, Instagram’s advertising platform is quite lucrative for both the company and its brand partners - it generated between $250-400 million in 2014, and its users generated 2x engagement when compared to Facebook. However, the same article illustrates that Instagram is underutilized by brands, indicating that “only 19% of marketers said they will Instagram a high priority in 2015.”</p><p>The <a href="https://business.instagram.com/advertising/">Instagram For Business portal</a> clearly explains the value proposition and types of integrations available to ad partners. However, it can be assumed that there is opportunity to improve both the offering &amp; its interactivity with Instagram’s user base.</p><p>In the following, I propose four areas in which Instagram could iterate and launch products toward a goal of <strong>increasing revenue by 20% over the course of a year</strong>. Each of these areas include both larger possible projects and small tests of user behavior. These areas are:</p><ol><li>Additional curation possibilities within the Explore experience</li><li>Feed and navigation experiments within the Instagram iOS/Android apps</li><li>Push notification experiments on Instagram iOS/Android</li><li>New, reaction-driven content types to generate more valuable insights from viewers</li><li>Better capitalization upon Instagram’s web app traffic</li><li>Introduction of a “premium” Instagram service offering for non-brands/advertisers</li></ol><p>It can be assumed that Instagram has a large product team that can potentially execute on most or all of these focus areas; however, I have attempted to prioritize them in order of effort, potential return on investment, and proximity to what I believe are Instagram’s core product values.</p><h3 id="1-additional-curation-possibilities-in-the-explore-tab">1. Additional curation possibilities in the Explore tab</h3><p>Instagram reportedly receives 80 million new photos per day, which is far too many for any average user to dig through to find the best photos. The Explore tab provides a huge opportunity to curate amazing content for its users, and the feature also presents an opportunity to provide even better targeting of great photos to its users - and generate additional revenue. However, while <a href="https://aytm.com/blog/daily-survey-results/instagram-explore-survey/">31% of surveyed Instagram users frequently explore photos by people they don’t follow, only about 21% of them use Explore and 19% of these users find the content in Explore within their interests</a>. The presents a big opportunity for improvement in the relevance and quality of content within Explore, and for revenue generation within Explore.</p><p>Instagram Explore currently only offers a single component containing curated content - the hero slider. This defaults to “This Week on Instagram,” a curated set of images, and contains a few other topically relevant curated topics. Everything else within the main Explore experience appears to be algorithmically generated (“trending tags” and popular posts seem to be all that’s available). How does one dig deeply into content that’s truly interesting to the user, and how does that tie back to revenue? Simply put: <strong>offering more diverse and relevant content to the end user will encourage further interaction with this content</strong>, thus increasing lifetime value and interaction with sponsored content.</p><p>There are a few ways to begin to tackle this problem. Let’s assume that the Explore tab is powered by a Content Management System that can push server-side updates to the app; this means that Instagram can begin easily testing different curation tactics. Beyond this, there are 3 main areas that could use improvement in the Explore product itself:</p><ol><li>Exposing other curated sets of content that are not immediately visible in the hero slider, perhaps via a “directory” sub-feature;</li><li>Experimenting with additional algorithmic hashtag feeds beyond “Trending tags”, such as Popular Near You (leveraging location) and Hidden Gems (content with high likes/comments but less popular hashtags);</li><li>Experimenting with basic categories of <strong>users</strong> to follow, in addition to posts. Instagram’s curation team could select brands &amp; users to populate these categories (eg. Socially Conscious Brands, Basketball Greats, Hot R&amp;B Musicians), and the categories could be integrated into the Explore screen.</li></ol><p>In each case, presumably, there is a wide variety of sponsored content (or content that can be later monetized) to be surfaced to the larger Instagram community. Instagram can test minimum-viable versions of each of these features and monitor clickthrough trends to understand the most effective types of exploratory tactics, further shaping a powerful discovery strategy for the Explore tab.</p><h3 id="2-feed--navigation-experiments-on-ios--android">2. Feed &amp; navigation experiments on iOS &amp; Android</h3><p>When one opens the Instagram app, the default view is his/her Feed, which contains both posts by whomever the user follows as well as occasional Sponsored posts. Presumably, this is the primary means by which users view and engage with these posts, but the core feature hasn’t changed much at all since its original inception in 2010. A small track of experiments within the core Instagram experience may create meaningful improvements to users’ engagement rate with sponsored content with low effort. Below are two tests to begin this track.</p><p><strong>1. Test higher frequency of Sponsored posts within the feed.</strong> Currently, Instagram displays a sponsored post approximately every 10-15 posts within the feed. Testing higher frequencies of sponsored posts might lead to higher ad impressions, clickthroughs and thus revenue.</p><p>This may adversely affect the customer experience by downplaying the amount of posts from the user’s friends - however, Instagram data may help gauge the possible negative effects here. For example, users who already follow brands on Instagram are less likely to be negatively affected by this change. Perhaps a follow-up test could be to target users who follow many brands differently than users who follow a few or no brands.</p><p><strong>2. Test the Explore tab as the default for users.</strong> While the feed is highly engaging, the Explore tab arguably exposes even more content to the end user through highly curated, popular and categorized Instagram posts. If Instagram made the Explore tab the primary view for its users, users may develop different and higher clickthrough habits and become exposed to even more sponsored &amp; branded content, leading to higher revenue for Instagram.</p><p>A simple first A/B test could be to render the Explore tab as the default screen for 50% of iOS users and monitor clickstream data for these users, compared to the remaining 50% control group. Subsequent tests could be run to optimize various other elements of the experience, such as:</p><ul><li>Which users see Explore or the Feed by default</li><li>A deeper introduction to Explore during the new user walkthrough, to encourage more usage of Explore earlier on</li><li>The placement of the two screens within the app navigation</li></ul><h3 id="3-experiments-with-push-notifications">3. Experiments with push notifications</h3><p>Currently, Instagram allows its users basic control over push notifications: for likes and comments from one’s followers or anyone, new follow requests, when one’s friends join Instagram, etc. However, Instagram can leverage carefully-positioned notifications to position interesting brands &amp; other ad clients toward its users.</p><p>Because notifications can be executed server-side, Instagram can create experiments around notifications promoting branded content in useful ways for its users. Below are just a few ideas for experiments that can be run:</p><ul><li>A/B test a new notification that notifies a user when 5 of his/her followers follow a given brand user, such as Nike. Enable the notified user to tap toward Nike’s profile immediately, or perhaps offer a one-click follow action.</li><li>A/B test the ability for certain brand clients to force-push a notification to its followers in some cases when the brand creates a new Instagram post. In practice, a brand like Nike can leverage this to announce exciting offers or contests to its follower base. This could allow Nike to increase impressions and clicks from its existing follower base.</li><li>A/B test a notification that informs a user of popular or sponsored posts that he/she may have missed in the past week (similar to <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/2015/while-you-were-away-0">Twitter’s “While You Were Away”</a> feature). Presumably, Instagram can track when a given user viewed or tapped on a post in his/her feed, and can use this to create a set of posts the user has <em>not</em> seen. If successful, this notification scheme can be further developed into a full-fledged feature for users and brands.</li></ul><p>In each case, one can monitor read and clickthrough rate on the notification scheme itself. Perhaps in a follow-up exercise, Instagram can allow users to enable/disable these new notifications schemes (enabled by default); a further test could monitor how many users proactively disable these notifications schemes.</p><h3 id="4-new-reaction-driven-content-types-for-brands">4. New, reaction-driven content types for brands</h3><p>Currently, Instagram offers photos, videos and multi-image sliders (each of which may contain clickthrough actions, such as a link to redeem a coupon) as content types to its brand partners. However, various other content-driven networks have experimented with other media types with success - for example, Twitter’s new Polls feature has <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/twitter-polls#comment-167861">helped drive a meaningful increase in conversations</a> around a given poll’s topic than standard Tweets. Buzzfeed has also successfully experimented with “reactions” widgets within their content pages, both in terms of <a href="http://s3-ak.buzzfed.com/static/downloads/BuzzFeed_Badges_Case_Study.pdf">increasing user engagement</a> and <a href="http://www.reactiontools.com/en/top-websites/playbuzz/">better categorizing their content</a>.</p><p>The meaningful takeaway here is this: if a user can create content with the ability for other users to react directly and intentionally, the users will establish a deeper connection with the brand and its content footprint. A reaction should require less overhead than an original comment but more investment than a “heart.” Instagram can experiment with other content types in this vein to allow brands to both <em>drive increased clickthroughs</em> and <em>gain more valuable insights</em> from their Instagram followers.</p><p>Three possible approaches, all of which have been successfully employed by other content-driven businesses, are:</p><ul><li>Experimenting additional reactions to Instagram posts, in addition to the “heart.” These could be confined to small set of Emojis corresponding to particular emotions at first, and receive further iterations over time.</li><li>Creating a “poll” (or “hot or not”) content type, which would allow a brand to combine two photos into a single post and grant the viewer the ability to tap on either. This would “cast a vote” for one of the two photos and increment a simple counter on the back-end. The brand could receive insights from the counters to learn the opinions of its users, similar to the aforementioned Twitter approach.</li><li>Allowing businesses to create posts that self-destruct after a given time period elapses from initial view. The viewer may be incentivized to act upon the business’ Instagram post to receive an offer or discount in a limited time. This could meaningfully incentivize casual followers of the business to interact with more of its content.</li></ul><p>If any of these content types are successful in driving more meaningful engagement (clickthrough rate, likes and impressions) with brands’ content, they may be rolled out to the larger Instagram community for use afterward.</p><h3 id="5-missed-opportunities-on-the-web">5. Missed opportunities on the web</h3><p>According to compete.com, Instagram.com (the minimal web app that Instagram launched in 2012) has been increasing in traffic over the past year - it received 55 million unique visitors this October, and has sustained this traffic through November. Yet the web interface has no trace of the sponsored content - leading to a pleasant, minimalist UI with plenty of room to grow.</p><p>It’s safe to assume that a majority of Instagram’s web traffic is coming from referrals to specific photo pages, rather than Instagram.com itself - users naturally are sharing their Instagram photos on various other social networks, and clickthroughs are routing users to those specific photo detail pages. However, there is potentially an opportunity to drive users from these pages deeper into the Instagram for Web experience, in which sponsored posts could be surfaced.</p><p>First, one can run experiments on Instagram.com pages to test clickthrough methods. Let’s assume that clickthrough rate from an Instagram photo post to another page on Instagram.com page is 0.5%. Several tests could be run to drive an increase in clickthroughs, such as:</p><ul><li>Adding a clear link to the user’s Instagram feed in the top navigation</li><li>Adding various useful links to the site’s top navigation (Explore, Following, Followers, etc.)</li><li>On the photo detail page, displaying “related” photos or additional photos by the given user</li></ul><p>The above experiments will likely increase the amount of traffic to Instagram.com, the feed, such that including sponsored content within the website may prove lucrative for generating revenue.</p><h3 id="6-one-last-monetization-thought-instagram-premium">6. One last monetization thought: Instagram Premium</h3><p>There are some Instagram users who will not respond to sponsored content, regardless of its relevance or quality. It could be worthwhile to explore the possibility of a “premium” Instagram experience, in which a user pays a recurring membership fee in exchange for an ad-free experience as well as other useful premium features.</p><p>Instagram could determine the demand and value of this premium membership concept by surveying segments of its users, such as:</p><ul><li>its most active non-business users</li><li>its users who most frequently open the app but never view the Explore tab</li><li>its users who post frequently but rarely browse the app</li><li>its users who interact primarily via notifications</li></ul><p>Obviously, offering users the ability to <em>bypass sponsored content</em> for a premium puts brands at a disadvantage, shrinking the size of their potential impressionable market. However, depending on the apparent demand of an ad-free experience and the potential success of other initiatives to grow impressions and clickthrough rate for sponsored content, this could be explored later.</p><h1 id="in-defense-of-miley-cyrus-and-her-dead-petz">In Defense of <em>Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz</em></h1><h2 id="music-that-challenged-me-in-2015-part-one">Music that challenged me in 2015, part one</h2><p>I haven’t written a “favorite albums” list in a few years, mostly because I realized that mine were virtually identical to most of those my friends would write up. That’s one of the unfortunate downsides of having friends in the music industry: if a band gets enough hype to be in a Top 10 list, everyone’s talking about that band.</p><p>2015 was one of the first years in a while, though, in which a lot of the buzzed-about music was downright <strong>ambitious</strong>: while there was plenty of crap for the masses to party/drone to, there were also plenty of musicians who stopped giving a fuck about playing nice and made cool, interesting, challenging music. Cases in point: Kendrick Lamar, Bjork’s Vulnicura, “Hotline Bling” and Titus Andronicus’ 90-minute manic depression rock opera, just to start.</p><p>I felt inspired by all this and had one of the more prolific years of writing music I’ve ever had. Some of the music I found most challenging and inspiring, though, was reviled, dismissed, or missed entirely by mainstream music journalism. I’d like to spend some time reflecting on the hidden genius of <strong>those</strong> songs and albums.* </p><h2 id="lets-start-with-a-doozy-miley-cyrus-and-her-dead-petz-released-via-soundcloud--vma-surprise-in-august">Let’s start with a doozy: <em>Miley Cyrus and her Dead Petz</em>, released via SoundCloud &amp; VMA surprise in August.</h2><p>I don’t dance much, but two songs this year made me start dancing more than any other: “King Kunta,” for obvious reasons, and Miley Cyrus’ “Slab of Butter (Scorpion).”</p><p>Don’t ask me why. I can’t explain it. But that damn bouncy synth texture paired with a fuzz bass made for my downtempo jam of 2015, and I’m not mad about it. I’m only mad when it ends, and then after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dW5M4QuxnKc">45 seconds of Miley talking about how drunk she is</a>, the beat comes back in the form of a fun diss track called “I Forgive Yiew” (sic, but who cares? Miley sure doesn’t). The slow bounce continues for another 3 minutes, and it’s kind of glorious.</p><p>The next song, “I Get So Scared,” haunted the shit out of me when I first heard it. It still does, which is a weird thing to digest given that this is BASICALLY HANNAH MONTANA telling me that “they say love grows / but I’ve only seen it die.” After that happens, I find mellow euphoria in “Lighter,” a highly underrated 80s throwback.</p><p>People HATED this album. I don’t. It’s weird and sprawling and usually inappropriate, but every time I come back to it, I find another nugget of something charming, dark or downright beautiful. “I Get So Scared” is one of those nuggets.</p><p>Sure, it starts with the silly “Dooo It!”, but immediately after you get 2 solid ballads in “Karen Don’t Be Sad” and “The Floyd Song.” For every stupid track on this album, you get multiple gems. Sure, “Milky Milky Milk” is probably a song about lactating, but it has one of the coolest beats of the year. Sure, Miley cries when singing about Pablow her dead blowfish, but you can’t fault her for expressing some real emotion in a song. The 6-song run of “Cyrus Skies” to “Lighter” is pretty fantastic, and could make for an excellent psych-pop EP in itself.</p><p>I do think Miley brought some of the bad rap and <a href="http://www.spin.com/2015/09/review-miley-cyrus-fakes-her-own-career-suicide-on-miley-cyrus-and-her-dead-petz/">flat-out dismissal</a> upon herself - the “complete, full-metal DGAF” approach to album structure and focus, plus the fact that she made this album outside of her recording contract, lends the album to be taken both <em>less</em> seriously and <em>more</em> like it’s trying be taken seriously. Most of the negative or apathetic critical reaction has been based on the assumption that this album <em>should</em> be interpreted as higher-concept than it probably should be. And to those critics, it disappoints as a high-concept pet project.</p><p>But why should we treat <em>Dead Petz</em> as anything beyond what it is at face value? It’s a long, sprawling collection of songs covering several topics, some of which are very silly. Nobody gave Prince any flack about that when <em>1999</em> came out and contained a <a href="http://genius.com/Prince-delirious-lyrics">song about vinegar strokes</a> and <a href="http://prince.org/msg/7/284088">another one with 2 uncomfortable minutes of orgasm sounds</a>. Why should Miley Cyrus be dismissed for calling a song “Bang Me Box” when <a href="http://genius.com/Nicki-minaj-anaconda-lyrics">Nicki Minaj can release a song glorifying her own ass</a>, or <a href="http://genius.com/Fetty-wap-trap-queen-lyrics">a song about a girl who makes crack cocaine</a> became one of the top hits of the year? (Oh and remember when a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped_Up_Kicks#Composition_and_inspiration">song about shooting up a school</a> became a pop hit? Great job, music industry.) <em>Dead Petz</em> doesn’t need to be anything more than it is, and critics shouldn’t dismiss it because it doesn’t reach their impossibly high standards of long, ambitious works that break political or spiritual ground. <strong>It’s as if critics are no longer willing to let their subjects just unwind and not be taken too seriously.</strong></p><p>If anything, this album disappoints me because it makes me wonder how it would have been accepted if a few throwaway tracks were removed and it was a <em>bit</em> more polished. If “Fuckin’ Fucked Up” (which should not be treated as anything more than an interlude) was removed from the track listing and was attached to “BB Talk” as a prelude, would people use it as an excuse to dismiss the album? “Something About Space Dude” is effectively a coda to “The Floyd Song” - what if Miley positioned these two separate tracks as a single 8-minute space rock epic, like what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoveStoned#Critical_response">JT did with some of his solo material</a>?</p><p>For those who want to give this album a second chance but can’t deal with the full 23 tracks, I propose a revised <em>Dead Petz</em> track listing, which is <em>only</em> an hour long:</p><ol><li>Dooo It! <em>&lt;— only because nothing else really works as an opener</em></li><li>Karen, Don’t Be Sad</li><li>The Floyd Song (Sunrise) <em>w/ optional coda: Something About Space Dude</em></li><li>Space Boots</li><li>BB Talk</li><li>Milky Milky Milk</li><li>Cyrus Skies</li><li>Slab of Butter (Scorpion) <em>w/ optional coda: I’m So Drunk</em></li><li>Lighter</li><li>I Get So Scared</li><li>I Forgive Yiew</li><li>1 Sun</li><li>Pablow The Blowfish</li><li>Miley Tibetan Bowlzzz <em>(bonus track)</em></li></ol><p>It’s really hard to take Miley Cyrus seriously, and that’s okay. Bizarrely enough, the thing that convinced me to have respect for her is the album in which she takes herself the least seriously. You should give this album a chance if you didn’t yet this year.</p><p>—- Oh, and lastly, I put out an EP too, but it’s probably not on anyone’s best-of lists because I barely promoted it. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/sphmrs/sets/of-our-lives-ep">Check it out</a>, though! It’s fun.</p><h1 id="engaged-tone-deaf--color-blind">Engaged, tone deaf &amp; color blind</h1><p>I proposed to Alicia over the weekend. It took almost a year, but I finally did it. I had a <a href="http://sophiehughes.com">custom engagement ring</a> made and I took her out to a <a href="http://troquetboston.com">beautiful dinner overlooking Boston Common</a> and I walked her around the <a href="http://www.cityofboston.gov/parks/emerald/Public_Garden.asp">Public Garden</a> and then we celebrated at the <a href="http://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/boston-parker-house">Omni Parker House</a>.</p><p>Simple, but classic us.</p><p>The amount of anxiety that you get when trying to pull off a proposal is staggering. It’s not even necessarily the <em>hardest</em> decision of your life — since we’re madly in love with each other and it was a no-brainer — but it’s still a massive commitment that relies on a level of faith &amp; confidence in both the relationship and oneself. I had wanted to say something ultra-romantic and profound before getting down on my knee…but I totally choked under my own anxiety. I ended up just kissing her repeatedly to hide my sweating and buy myself time to figure out something to say.</p><p><strong>Which is when I reminded myself, again:</strong> if you really love someone (or something, for that matter), why the anxiety at all? Drop the anxiety. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0">Just do it</a>.</p><p>So I did! And now we can call each other our fiancés.</p><p>Oh, here are some pictures of us being cute and engaged and stuff.</p><h1 id="my-must-have-osx-products-of-2015">My must-have OSX products of 2015</h1><p>I became a heavy reader of the <a href="http://macstories.net">Macstories blog</a> this year, both as an ardent Apple fanboy and as a proponent of good, honest, analytical writing about tech. With tech journalism being largely pandering clickbait these days, it’s nice to read Federico Viticci and his team’s insightful and personal writeups about the state of Apple tech, supporting independent developers and great ideas along the way.</p><p>Since he went full-iOS this year (and <a href="https://www.macstories.net/roundups/my-must-have-ios-apps-2015-edition/">wrote</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/why-2do-is-my-new-favorite-ios-task-manager/#fnref-41252-mac">about</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/">it</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/">like</a> <a href="https://www.macstories.net/ios/sidefari-lets-you-browse-two-webpages-at-once-with-ios-9-split-view-and-safari-view-controller/">crazy</a>), I tried to do the same. However, with my heavy interests in music production and learning to code better, I could not get rid of my Retina MacBook Pro - it’s just too deeply ingrained into my lifestyle and, frankly, is too damn beautiful and powerful to pass up. It’s also been a fantastic year for development of Mac products, not just for Macs themselves, but for hardware and software developers in the space.</p><p>Here are some of the most indispensable apps for Mac I discovered this year.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2do/id477670270?mt=12">2Do for Mac</a>. Federico’s write-ups, while great and detailed, only touched on the amazing new 2Do for iOS, but I wanted to call out this app as it relates to Mac OS X. I got 2Do for free earlier this year thanks to a great Apple promotion, and it got me more on top of my to-do’s than I’ve ever been before. Adding a Mac app into the mix (at half price, thanks to yet another promotion!) turned this helpful task organizer into a full-fledge productivity suite for me. I used 2Do for Mac similar to how Federico uses it on his enormous iPad Pro screen - bulk-moving, delegating and dating tasks with ease, relying on Task Actions to easily get to websites and emails I need to check on, and even multitasking split-screen in El Capitan. It’s a pretty fantastic tool.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reeder-3/id880001334?mt=12">Reeder 3</a>. Reeder has been my RSS/news reader app of choice for years, but when v3 for OS X came out this year it gained even more value in my day-to-day. With new Instapaper API integration and a beautiful new look, I can get all my news updates and long-form reading done - without ever having to open a website.</p><p><a href="http://panic.com/coda">Coda 2.5</a>. This year, my fiancée and I launched <a href="http://tonedeafcolorblind.com">Tone Deaf &amp; Color Blind</a>, a blog in which we try to explore more creative outlets in our lives (one of which is writing - hey!). I had done plenty of Wordpress tinkering before, but this was the first website I built and launched fully by myself - from creating a local dev environment to hacking major blocks of PHP. I was originally trying to make sense of Sublime Text and all its plugins, but I wanted something that (1) was easy enough to manage without having to constantly tweak the program, and (2) something I could also use on the go. Coda overwhelmingly has satisfied my needs here, between the comprehensive and easy-to-use Mac app and the newly-revamped Coda for iOS.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id623795237?mt=12">Ulysses</a>. Starting Tone Deaf &amp; Color Blind, as well as realizing a need to write more in my life, made me want to seek out a good means to organize &amp; execute upon my thoughts. I tried out a few different apps - Editorial, Byword, a few raw text editors - and none of them seemed to jive with my organizational style. I wanted an app that could both let me focus on writing things down <em>and</em> easily access different blurbs, notes, etc. and group them together however I wanted. Ulysses was that app - after getting over the slight sticker shock of its price, I’m happy to have added this app to my personal ecosystem. And now that <a href="http://ulyssesapp.com/beta">Ulysses for iPhone is available in beta</a>, I can even manage this stuff on the go.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweetbot-for-twitter/id557168941?mt=12">Tweetbot</a>. I also tried to start building my personal brand this year on Twitter. Part of why I sucked at this previously was due to the lack of a good free Mac app. Twitter’s own app was never great, and Tweetdeck/Hootsuite were always too ugly and buggy for me to buy into. However, when Tapbots updated Tweetbot this year I decided to try it out - and between their Mac and iOS apps I’ve become far more interested in what’s out there in the Twitterverse.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slack/id803453959?mt=12">Slack</a>. We don’t use Slack at my day job, sadly, but it’s become invaluable to me - both as a water-cooler-of-sorts with some of my close colleagues and a vital means of bouncing ideas for my side projects. While I love the ability to quickly act on messages from my iPhone, I love having a full conversation thread on my MacBook screen while I research UX ideas or wireframing an idea.</p><p><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/r/02b8185569f160/34033">Copyfeed</a>. I used to think that my Mac and my iPhone were, other than some compatible apps, largely separate. I could sync photos and email, but text was elusive beyond text messaging to myself. Drafts and other iOS-only apps solved this between iOS devices; Copyfeed makes text (and images) easily and instantly shareable across my phone and my laptop.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/divvy-window-manager/id413857545?mt=12">Divvy</a>. Sometimes I plug my MacBook Pro into an ultra-wide <a href="http://www.amazon.com/LG-Electronics-34UM95-34-Inch-LED-Lit/dp/B00JR6GCZA">LG UM95</a> monitor, which is the best screen for managing large recording sessions. However, when I have many modules (or apps) open, the screen gets fairly chaotic. Divvy lets me easily organize things on the screen simply, either by dragging across a small grid or with keyboard shortcuts.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alfred/id405843582?mt=12">Alfred</a>. Alfred has and will always replace the stock Spotlight function for me, if only for the ability to perform a Google search outside Safari. I’ve also become incredibly dependent on some awesome workflows for <a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/193-weather-workflow-with-conditions-and-forecast/">checking the weather</a>, <a href="https://github.com/carlosgaldino/alfred-emoji-workflow">finding emojis</a>, <a href="http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1009-notes/">instantly create a note</a> or <a href="http://www.packal.org/workflow/trello-search">search all my Trello boards</a>, to name a few.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id443987910?mt=12">1Password</a>. For as much buzz 1Password got for its stellar iOS integration last year, I think it’s integration into the OS X ecosystem is almost more invaluable to how I work. I absolutely love having constant access to my logins from the OS X menubar or any browser window, and I trust it as my main directory for all things private &amp; secure.</p><p><a href="https://justgetflux.com">F.lux</a>. This thing keeps my eyes from going bloodshot far more often than I give it credit.</p><p><a href="http://numi.io">Numi</a>. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve had to do more and more math: for doing my own taxes, for settling bills, for budgeting a move and an eventual wedding. Each of these use cases require a lot of context beyond just the numbers - it’s necessary to know what numbers correspond to what in reality. Having Numi to both store this context and automatically perform complex mathematical operations has been absolutely invaluable, and I cannot recommend it highly enough for Mac users.</p><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wallcat/id1000397973?mt=12">Wallcat</a>. I’ve become obsessed with something crazy - **my laptop’s desktop background **- thanks to Wallcat. Every day I have new beautiful artwork from the wonderful folks at Unsplash, and every day I think, “This one’s lovely - I should stick to this one.” Then I forget to set it as my permanent background and get another amazing image to enjoy the next morning.</p><p><a href="http://www.apple.com/logic-pro/">Logic Pro X</a>. I’ve gone back and forth with a few different DAWs for a while for making music: Sonar and Cubase interchangeably in college, Reason once it could do audio too, Pro Tools for a minute, Presonus Studio One because I was begged to try it. But once Apple dropped the price of Logic Pro to $200, I was compelled to try it out. I haven’t turned to any other</p><p><a href="https://www.propellerheads.se/reason">Reason 8</a>. Logic has unfortunately led to a drop in my Reason usage, but the Kong drum machine, Thor synthesizer and surprisingly great piano sampler (see: Concert Grand Piano Combinator preset) make this very much worth keeping around.</p><p><a href="https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups">Balsamiq Mockups</a>. This has been my wireframing app of choice for years now. I firmly believe in designing functionally and essentially, and not getting wrapped up in the visual details of a design. Balsamiq is intentionally ugly (sooooo much Comic Sans), but it allows me to explore a functional idea and focus on getting the most important elements into the right place.</p><p><a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a>. For some reason, I hate hate hate web apps - I guess you could blame my browser tab anxiety. Trello is the one exception to this rule, and it’s become my go-to for project collaboration. Fortunately, someone made a Mac app called <a href="http://lingsdesigns.com/xccello/">Xccello</a> to contain it’s awesomeness.</p><hr /><p>There you have it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcszyb5d7nA">In the spirit of Perd Hapley</a>, I wrote this to communicate something, and that thing was a list of products I relied on this year, and the story of those products is that I used them on a Mac.</p><p>Big thanks to <a href="http://producthunt.com">Product Hunt</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> and some of my colleagues for sourcing most of these apps for me. Onto the next year!</p><h1 id="on-pop-writing">On “pop writing”</h1><h3 id="im-gonna-repeat-the-chorus-and-im-gonna-sing-it-til-im-blue-in-the-face">I’m gonna repeat the chorus, and I’m gonna sing it ’til I’m blue in the face</h3><p>This is a note in response to various posts written on Medium in the last few weeks: one of which was effectively a ripoff another, one of which brought up the fairly obvious point that top content producers (by means of likes &amp; shares, not quality, which is subjective) might <a href="https://medium.com/@kamilstanuch/when-somebody-steals-your-medium-post-d233625da491#.6jpwrve3q">simply rip each other off</a>, and a <a href="https://medium.com/@benbelser/the-endless-echo-chamber-of-online-influencers-and-how-they-re-robbing-the-internet-of-its-soul-1a5751e275df#.z56v7r4cu">final one which brought to light the inherent problem with all of this</a>.</p><p>The problem described isn’t specific to Medium: virtually all written nonfiction on the Internet that gets clicked on by the masses is specifically meant to get clicked on by the masses. A great subset of writers on Medium are no different. Original, interesting writing gets shoved into obscurity while the majority of readers see these repetitive listicles, hollow advice columns and “thought pieces” about <a href="https://medium.com/swlh">Startups, Wanderlust and Life Hacking</a> - because that’s what people appear to want to read. The numbers show it.</p><p>I’m fine with that, sure, in small doses. These days, you need some positive motivation to deal with the shitstorm mess that is modern reality. But after a while, as <a href="https://medium.com/@benbelser/the-endless-echo-chamber-of-online-influencers-and-how-they-re-robbing-the-internet-of-its-soul-1a5751e275df#.yyma5c7nw">Ben Belser suggests</a>, it gets old. Thousands of “influencers” circlejerking on hearts and fuzzies to promote themselves without giving a shit about what they’re actually saying, robbing the Internet of its soul.</p><p>I realized something the other day: <strong>Isn’t this basically the same as pop music?</strong></p><p>Hundreds of thousands of songwriters, composers and performers over generations, mostly working within the same general realm of tonality, mostly attempting to portray the same general emotions and ideas, oftentimes even ripping each other off for the sake of marketability. There are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20optimize%20my%20song%20for%20top%2040%20radio#q=how+to+write+a+hit+song">millions of blog posts, ironically enough, about how to do this</a>.</p><p>Think about it: all of the most popular songs in the US right now can be confined to a tiny number of styles (hip hop, synth pop, country, with a few rock hits and retro throwbacks). Almost all of these songs are about the following: love, sex, drugs, partying, loneliness, angst. Many even feature the same ideas (emotional or musical) or even the same artists (looking at you, Tay Swift). There are incredibly few exceptions to this rule in the past 15 years - nu metal was an incredibly dumb angry fad, but even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTMVOzPPtiw">Limp Bizkit’s lyrics largely stayed within the confines</a> of the aforementioned 6 topics.</p><p><strong>How is this any different from going on Medium one morning and seeing virtually the exact same blog posts you saw 2 weeks prior?</strong> The posts are obviously not the same - maybe a different author, a different sponsor, a different tip to make you fitter, happier, more productive - but they’re largely interchangeable. <a href="https://medium.com/@kamilstanuch/when-somebody-steals-your-medium-post-d233625da491#.5ch20sd0v">Sometimes they are even virtually the same</a>. <strong>Like pop music.</strong></p><p>So I’ve started to call the majority of what Medium feeds me something else: <strong>pop writing</strong>. Marketable, interchangeable writing to satisfy the masses. Blogs (at least the most popular ones on Medium) are no longer personal or honest or catering to a particular interest - their sole purpose is to maximize the marketability of the writer’s brand. Not unlike any top 40 artist, CamMi Pham (whose writing and general vibe mostly infuriate me) has a carefully curated personal brand, which draws elements from positivity-pumping wellness and advice writing (and sometimes, directly from other writers). She’s trying to be the Tay Swift of your Medium feed. This fine - millions of people love Taylor Swift, and thousands of people love CamMi Pham’s deliberate, speech-like writing on learning and unlearning and bettering oneself.</p><p>You want to figure out how her written brand works? It’s pretty simple, actually.</p><h1 id="come-up-with-a-really-fucking-edgy-attention-grabbing-title">Come up with a really fucking edgy, attention-grabbing title.</h1><p>Start with some one-sentence paragraphs.</p><p>Write increasingly powerful and emotional statements in those paragraphs.</p><p>Maybe a sentence implying initial self-doubt.</p><h2 id="then-throw-out-a-big-initial-thesis">Then throw out a big initial thesis.</h2><p>Usually in bold or headline style.</p><p>Then repeat that thesis verbatim, followed by a supporting reason.</p><p>The repeat that thesis verbatim again, with further reasons.</p><p><strong>What about this other reason?</strong> No need to worry, because here’s that thesis again. With another supporting reason.</p><h2 id="and-that-is-the-thesis-verbatim-once-more">And that is the thesis, verbatim once more.</h2><h2 id="pure-unadulterated-crap">Pure, unadulterated crap.</h2><p>King Crimson (which most people probably know, sadly, from when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L53gjP-TtGE">Kanye West sampled them</a>) have this great song called <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kingcrimson/happywithwhatyouhavetobehappywith.html">“Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With”</a> which is basically a brilliant exercise in hollow meta-songwriting. Most of the lyrics discuss the structure of the song itself:</p><blockquote><p>And when I have some words this is the way I’ll sing through a distortion box to make them menacing</p></blockquote><p>It makes for a great commentary on the cookie-cutter nature of pop music construction - there are tropes that one can follow to clearly evoke some kind of emotional response, so we exploit them for maximum feeling. Adrian Belew (the singer) clearly describes the section of the song, what emotion must be evoked within it, and how he intends to portray that emotion; by the time he’s in the second chorus, he’s made it clear the song itself has no meaning: “I’ll brew another pot / of ambiguity.” The bridge, “you have to be happy with what you have to be happy with,” just reinforces that - it’s a nothing statement, weirdly urgent but pointless, endlessly repeating like the advice pieces on my Medium top feed.</p><p>(Ironically, that song was written music-first, and the <a href="http://www.vintagerock.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=70:adrian-belew-king-crimson&amp;catid=3:interviews&amp;Itemid=4">lyrics were thrown in last minute as placeholder</a>. Do you think Adrian Belew cares about what I think the song means? He’s not even making pop music.)</p><p>Like how pop music leverages chord progressions and romantic/lonely/excited feelings, Pop Writing leverages the nurturing nature of self-help, the inspiring nature of startup culture &amp; life disruption, pandering political fluff and a few other obvious topics. <strong>Let’s call them “subgenres.”</strong> Each subgenre, and some artists within that subgenre, have particular conventions that are proven to be more effective than others. It’s already obvious that clickbait article titles is a common theme among all subgenres of pop writing. Some others: pick an icon and find an obscure fact about him or her; pick a bad quality about yourself and gradually turn it good; pander to the founders of an amazing product; respond to that pandering by shitting on said product; give advice to the most blogged-about professionals.</p><p>Like how pop music is hard to pigeonhole by conventions but easy to pick out, pop writing is hard to pigeonhole by topic to easy to pick out. One can easily pick up on the writing style of a blogger and exploit it for their own gain. Just pick a topic (even if it’s been <a href="https://medium.com/keep-learning-keep-growing/why-steve-jobs-wore-the-same-outfit-every-day-f792072f7ecf#.imtr2jamh">beaten to death</a>), read a few popular articles on that topic and pick up on the sentence and paragraph structure. Write a few test-drive articles to hone your skill, and then start marketing your brand. You’re basically doing what Taylor Swift did when she decided she wanted to move into pop music - developing your brand to reach a new audience.</p><p>If that’s what you feel like doing with your spare time, weirdo.</p><h2 id="medium-is-going-the-way-of-the-music-industry-but-thats-fine">Medium is going the way of the music industry, but that’s fine.</h2><p>Nothing should stop CamMi Pham from writing like she does. Medium definitely shouldn’t stop her. That’s the free market blogging economy at work. Instead, let’s just call it what it is: happy, cookie-cutter, highly targeted pop blogging that will gain her new followers. The market demands it.</p><p>The problem seems to ultimately lie in the writer’s convictions. Yann Girard might be more genuine in his writing, but he might not be. Someone writing about a life tip they just discovered might genuinely be so excited about it that they’re compelled to share it with the world. S/he might also be plagiarizing someone else. Who knows?</p><p>Maybe the problem ultimately lies in the newfound stigma for content marketing and “social influencers” - people who are paid to get clicks and followers, and thus the honesty of their writing is instantly called into question. Maybe these people could rebrand themselves to appear more honest. CamMi Pham is unapologetic - <a href="https://medium.com/life-learning/a-confession-i-am-a-fraud-7ae192b94914#.lm1t53653">she admits to being a total fraud</a> and attempts to justify it (within her standard writing convention, of course). Yes, she might be encouraging young writers to steal ideas from others and develop a contrived style of writing that eschews honesty for marketability - but again, if that’s what people want to read, then more power to the writers.</p><p>For those who don’t like it: welcome to the beginnings of literary snobbery. Three immediate suggestions for you:</p><ol><li><p>If you don’t like pop writing, simply don’t read it. Just as I usually avoid the Top 40 like the plague, stop reading the Top Posts on Medium and find writing you like via other means: use Medium’s tags, start curating who you follow, or look elsewhere entirely.</p></li><li><p>If you think Medium isn’t listening and want to help out writers you care about, start your own subculture. Radio failed to capture many niche music genres and scenes, so music blogs popped up to try and promote music in those niches. Maybe fans of certain types of writing will subscribe to a blog or network that heavily caters to a certain niche of fiction or nonfiction. There doesn’t need to be one blogging platform.</p></li><li><p>If you do <strong>genuinely</strong> have some honest advice or learnings to share with the world, do so genuinely. Please refrain from marketing tropes, because people can see through that shit. Tell the world what you know, how you feel about it, and if you pulled it from somewhere else, be honest about it. I love reading <a href="https://medium.com/@jasonfried">Jason Fried</a>’s posts for this reason - he’s honest, witty and daring and has legitimate reason &amp; experience to pull off all three.</p></li></ol><hr /><p>I’m going to tag this post and hope it gets some likes and shares (which, by the way, you should do if you think it’s useful). It probably won’t, though, because I’m not a digital influencer with 500+ followers on Medium.</p><p>Yet.</p><p>Because I’ll keep trying.</p><p>Maybe I should read one of those “Top 10 Ways to Find Success on Medium” posts for help.</p><h1 id="on-macs-and-focus">On Macs and focus</h1><p>I own an iPad, but I really only use it to watch Netflix in bed with my fiancée since my iPhone 6s Plus is just too small enough for both of us to watch simultaneously. Outside of this pretty obvious use case, I’ve struggled to find a purpose for the gorgeous device in my life.</p><p>Everywhere I turn, though, I read about another person finding the iPad completely invaluable in their daily lives. It now exceeds the processing power of the average PC; its app ecosystem is generally much cheaper than the PC app ecosystem; it’s “more fun” to use than any device before. A lot of people who write about the iPad suggest that it allows for a <strong>level of focus beyond what Macs or PCs can allow</strong>.</p><p><strong>I call bullshit.</strong> Anyone who says the Mac is too distracting has not given the Mac a fair shot since, well, 2 or 3 versions ago of OS X. Apple has made a series of beautiful, powerhouse laptops, build for demanding technical work - that also happen to be incredibly pleasant to use and conducive to focus.</p><p>I’m not suggesting that the iPad isn’t a great device - it truly is a pleasure to use. However, so are Macs, and some tech pundits seem to forget this. Efficiency on a Mac isn’t even a question worth asking - sure, you eschew a touch screen for a keyboard &amp; multi-touch trackpad, but the sheer ergonomics of having both the keyboard &amp; trackpad within millimeters of each other compared to jumping between keyboard and screen are staggering. Sometimes you want to lay back and relax, but when you need to <strong>work</strong>, the Mac wins every time.</p><p><strong>The question really is about one’s ability to focus on a single task or project while working on a laptop/desktop computer.</strong> Tons of people have written about this. Those same people have tried incessantly for years to justify usage of an iPad for as many possible use cases as possible: blogging, note-taking, long-form writing, designing, music producing, analyzing spreadsheets, chatting with many people at once. I keep asking myself: <strong>what’s the goal of being able to do all these things on an iPad, other than attempting to justify my impulse purchase of an iPad?</strong></p><p>If the goal is focus, I’ve wanted to try and tame the beast and have my Mac work to my advantage. Basically, a means of avoiding this: <img src="#" /></p><p>Hey, guess what? It’s really to avoid the above with really minimal effort and discipline. Between the iterative improvements brought to OS X and its huge app ecosystem, it’s really easy to make a Mac your portable productivity powerhouse. (Alliteration intentional.) And while the Mac app ecosystem is technically smaller than that of iOS, that has its benefits: less crap to weed through.</p><p>I have to give Apple props for identifying the key aspects that make iOS so pleasant to use and employing them in some fashion within OS X. For instance:</p><p><strong>Launchpad</strong> is a solid app launcher and organizer; after a bit of reorganizing, it effectively replicates the iOS home screen.

Yes, it came at a higher price point than the average iPad and I purchased it primarily with music creation in mind.</p><p>But considering the top-of-the-line iPad Pro is virtually the same price as (and comparable in spec to) the ultrathin MacBook, it ultimately comes down to user preference.

In the words of indie darling Courtney Barnett, sometimes I (want to) sit and think, and sometimes I just (want to) sit.</p><p>I’m a product manager, which means I spend virtually every weekday (and some weekends) doing two things: <strong>solving problems</strong> and <strong>making things happen</strong> to ship good, need-fulfilling products. Anyone who does product management can obviously break this up into many more buckets of duties, glorify it, debate its role in larger business culture, whatever - but that’s essentially what we do.</p><p><strong>Sometimes I think I want to build something on my own</strong> - I wouldn’t be surprised if most PMs also get this urge. Thanks to a handful of tools that now exist, virtually anyone with Internet access and some spare time can build anything in a matter of hours or days. There’s a lot of people who create their own products on their own these days, using <a href="https://medium.com/everything-about-startups-and-entrepreneurship/300-awesome-free-things-e07b3cd5fd5b?utm_content=11686436&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=googleplus">free or cheap existing tools</a>, then publish them on sites like <a href="http://producthunt.com">Product Hunt</a> and write about them on Medium. When I read all these posts about “makers” making “products,” I react in a few ways.</p><h2 id="first-curiosity-then-a-little-bit-of-envy">First, curiosity, then a little bit of envy.</h2><p>I love that we now have technology and platforms available for <strong>anyone</strong> to turn some idea into a packaged product in a matter of hours.

Sometimes I wish I had.</p><h2 id="then-jealousy-fueled-anxiety">Then, jealousy-fueled anxiety.</h2><p>Why aren’t I identifying those problems? Why can’t I be making those things? What do those people have that I don’t? What do I need in order to build amazing profitable things myself? WHAT AM I DOING WITH MY LIFE??!!?!!?!!!</p><h2 id="then-a-ramble">Then, a ramble.</h2><p>Hours and hours on <a href="http://producthunt.com">Product Hunt</a>. More things made by more people. Curiosity and anxiety on subsequent repeat.</p><h2 id="then-im-tired">Then, I’m tired.</h2><p>I burned myself out worrying about other people’s problems instead of solving my own or those problems which I care about.</p><h2 id="why-did-i-do-that">Why did I do that?</h2><p>We used to have information overload. Then people rebranded this as *\<span><code class="inline-tag">#content*</code></span> in an attempt to legitimize it. Now, if the content wasn’t enough, we’re in <strong>maker overload.</strong> New startups and new people announcing new products being announced almost every hour on the hour. Call it a lovechild of social media and freelancer culture, both powered by the good ol’ Internet - now everyone can have their own voice, so there’s millions more voices, all yelling incessantly over each other for top placement on your Twitter feed. All so you try the hot new products they each built on their own.</p><p>What is the impact of all those new products? Sure, it’s huge in aggregate - if anything this is proven by how much pundits are talking about Product Hunt. But what value does each individual new solution to a problem have in the scheme of things?</p><p>Product management is really all about solving <strong>(the right)</strong> problems and enabling the people around you to solve them. Some of the “products” I come across solve problems that aren’t relevant to me at all, but because everyone is posting and writing and tweeting and retweeting about them I run into them anyway. Some of these products don’t solve any problem at all - they generate a problem of their own and attempt to solve it, even if the average person didn’t even need to recognize that as a problem in the first place. Some of those products are really just repackaging the exact same #content that other products already contain, only presented in a slightly different way. Just this year there were <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/search?q=resources+for">50 products launched</a>, all featured on Product Hunt, that repackage existing tools and content that already wasn’t too hard to find with a bit of Googling. Some of them are <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/front-end-list">totally</a> <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/always-learning">redundant</a> <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/freepik">with</a> <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/the-starter-kit">each</a> <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/agile-designers">other</a>.</p><p>I’m not saying this is inherently a problem - after all, competition makes the world go ‘round. But is this really what makers want to be known for?</p><p>Maybe so, or more likely those makers are just trying to make some money or followers. This isn’t new - companies have been making redundant products for the sake of staying competitive a long time - but now that the Internet has enabled for a product to get noticed and hyped in a matter of hours, there’s too much noise to be continuously making products that don’t matter in the scheme of things. It only adds to the information overload, except under the guise of something meant to solve a problem - so people who read about this product (especially those who religiously follow communities like Product Hunt) are inclined to take them more seriously than your standard clickbait. When they do, the maker gets noticed for a day, then just like clickbait, it usually gets lost in the ether of the Internet. Some makers then keep trying to optimize their offering and market fit until something sticks.</p><h2 id="perhaps-maker-culture-in-tech-has-also-gone-the-way-of-the-pop-music-industry"><a href="https://medium.com/@brandonlucasgreen/on-pop-writing-14c4a446a551#.3a47qxhbl">Perhaps “maker culture” in tech has also gone the way of the pop music industry.</a></h2><p>But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. I’m not suggesting that people stop building things for my own sake. Eventually you might happen across a brilliant solution to a truly challenging problem. Making things to satisfy urges or curiosities, make money, or to grow a personal brand is not inherently problematic - it does, however, create envy within others who aren’t sure they have those same needs. Especially when some of the most “popular” of those products made are redundant with each other or debated incessantly as to whether or not they’re dead.</p><p>I thought building my own things was what I should be doing with my life, but it turns out all the product overload is toxic for me. I get into a vicious cycle of anxiety and regret and forced ideation around problem spaces that really don’t need solutions at that moment. I don’t personally build things constantly to satisfy some inner need, but I also don’t want to <strong>build a career out of making things that follow trends.</strong></p><p>I solve problems all day, some of which are incredibly rewarding (like those that make my fiancée happy) and some of which are incredibly dull or frustrating (solved typically between the hours of 9am and 5pm, but even those are sometimes challenging and/or rewarding). In a world where an app can launch and die in a matter, and much of the writing about said app is about <a href="http://bgr.com/2016/01/11/peach-messaging-app-iphone-collapse/">whether</a> or <a href="http://arc.applause.com/2016/01/12/peach-app-app-store-data-analytics/">not it’s actually dead</a>, I don’t want to come home every day and keep doing the same thing - it only stresses me out more. My catharsis is writing songs or posts (like this). Sometimes I want to just watch something mindless or live vicariously through someone else.</p><p>And that’s probably why I go on Product Hunt for hours on end. Now I understand the appeal of reality television.</p><p>I came into 2016 thinking that I wanted to launch a product, and now that I’m understanding myself better in 2016, the less I feel a need to do that. I have a day job, I better satisfy my curiosities via music and writing, and I don’t have any immediately-obvious solutions to problems I care about. It’s more important to me to be with the people I love and be reflecting and thinking about those problems I <strong>do</strong> want to solve. If you think you need to be launching products for the sake of launching products, take a minute to think about the merits of doing so. Don’t be a maker just because everyone else is.</p><hr /><p>Did you enjoy reading this? Feel the same way about maker and product overload? Nice.

Thanks!</p><h1 id="a-small-set-of-apps-to-keep-me-creative">A small set of apps to keep me creative</h1><p>There’s something I keep having to remind myself: no matter how little time I have to put into art, I’m still an artist.</p><p>Still an artist, still making art. Music’s my medium of choice. Finding time to work on it is hard though, between wedding planning, an increasingly-demanding day job, other side projects - <strong>when can I play or write some music, dammit?</strong></p><p>Short, obvious answer: block my time like nobody’s business. That at least gets me time dedicated to working on the things I want to be working on. Once I’m there, how can I explore purely creative ideas and save them <strong>when my brain is full of all this other stuff</strong>? Equally short, equally obvious answer: technology helps me. But how?</p><p>I used to think that <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a> should be my catch-all for organizing my stuff to stay focused: important notes, snippets, ideas, lyrics, receipts, anything possibly necessary to retrieve in the future. Tagging and shortcuts, stacks o’ notebooks, so much control. I tried storing my lyrics, song ideas, high level album cycle plans, even task lists and reminders in there - but, as <a href="http://lifehacker.com%0Ahttp://lifehacker.com/5666954/avoid-everything-buckets-aka-why-i-cant-get-into-apps-like-evernote">others have noted</a>, I ended up overwhelmed anytime I even attempted to find something in the depths of Evernote’s robust (to a fault) categorization system. I had access to too many things all the time - I had to remember which tags corresponded to what in my bizarre system of organization, not to mention the hours blown trying to establish the system in the first place.</p><p>Then I tried <a href="http://2doapp.com">2Do</a> for a while - I figured that if I could abstract my tasks out of their various places into a single, meticulously organized place, I could get to all the other pertinent content via links. 2Do’s various features are great - but again I felt overwhelmed, like I was spending more time organizing my ideas than actually executing on them.</p><p>I realized that these approaches contradicted my way of thinking through my various blurbs of information when I need them.</p><p>So I worked out a new system. Here’s what my core criteria was for this:</p><ul><li>I <strong>cannot</strong> put all my things in one place, due to the sheer overwhelming of having to parse through it all each time.</li><li>Centralize the blurbs in the app best for those blurbs. For instance, the app that gets me quickest to my notes is the best one for the most important or most frequently used notes.</li><li>More abstract ideas that require gestation and iteration don’t require as quick access, but I need the flexibility to adjust, merge, rearrange those notes as my ideas come to fruition.</li><li>Markdown is amazing, but some ideas may require sketching, images, etc. so I can’t limit myself to just text.</li><li>I need this system to play nice with day-job work <em>and</em> creative work.</li></ul><hr /><p>Turns out I was able to devise a system that works for me quite well - and it’s not far off from what <a href="https://brooksreview.net/2016/01/ulysses-all-the-things/">others have written about recently</a>. Here’s a shortlist of the apps I use in this system:</p><h3 id="remindersapp-my-high-level-starting-point">Reminders.app: my high-level starting point</h3><p>Apple’s stock <strong>Reminders</strong> is what holds all my shit together. I tried using so many different task management apps and realized that the overcomplexity of these apps was what caused all my wasted time and lost focus in the first place. With iOS 9 and El Capitan, I can now save virtually anything to a Reminders list and have direct access to that thing, regardless of where it lives. I can even dump tasks straight into a list thanks to 3D Touch.</p><p><em>Disclaimer:</em> A big reason why I went with Reminders was due to iOS Exchange integration. We use Exchange at my work, whose Tasks feature I rely on to organize to-dos each day. Having access to them on my phone is invaluable, and while I loved <a href="http://2doapp.com">2Do</a> for my personal projects, I haven’t found a great iOS task manager that handles Exchange tasks.</p><p>I have a few key lists I rely on:</p><ul><li>I created an “Inbox” list that functions as my collector of tasks. I rely on Siri and share extensions to put everything into this list, and I sort out as needed later.</li><li>I have a list for each major focus area: <a href="http://wayfair.com">Wayfair</a> (via Exchange), <a href="http://sphmrs.com">Sophomores</a>, wedding planning, writing topics (for the blogs I contribute to), etc. I also have a generic “big goals” list for personal bucket-list items (starting a podcast, writing a book, etc.)</li><li>I also have a few lists for other things to reference: stuff to buy (Shopping), stuff to watch/listen (Media), stuff to take care of around the house (the Family list I share with <a href="http://laviecreative.co">Alicia</a>).</li><li>I rely on Smart Reminders to link to the given Note, Trello board, Ulysses sheet, or whatever else is pertinent to the given task. These were <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7261722?tstart=0">pretty problematic for the first few revisions of iOS 9</a>, but the 6th beta of iOS 9.3 seems to have fixed most of the problems I’ve had.</li><li>The default “Reminders” list itself is used for everything I need to do on a particular day, but I don’t care about until that day. Recurring tasks reside here, like laundry, taking out the trash or renewing my driver’s license.</li></ul><p>My one gripe with Reminders is a simple limitation on iOS: <strong>only manual sorting</strong>. The OS X Reminders app lets me sort easily by priority or due date, but I can only manually sort on iOS. If Apple adds a sorting feature to Reminders (like they’re doing with Notes), Reminders will finally be an app you might not scoff at.</p><h3 id="notesapp-for-all-quick-note-access--entry">Notes.app: for all quick note access &amp; entry</h3><p>Apple’s surprisingly pretty (to me - sorry, <a href="https://twitter.com/volkward/status/607974689139474433">haters</a>) and nimble <strong>Notes</strong> is my go-to for quick essentials: important links, high-level project plans and lists, account numbers (thanks, password lock!), stuff like that. I also use it as a less technical Drafts clone, for quick note-taking (thanks 3D Touch!) for sharing to other apps when needed. The goal here is to get to important things quickly and start writing quickly.</p><p>I’ve started to find Notes really useful for quick lists at a lower level than Reminders - for example, production &amp; mix notes. I listen back to my demos constantly while on-the-go, and I’m constantly writing down ideas and feedback for them. I don’t want to create a single Reminders list for each song or album I’m working on - that feels too heavy - but I can create a note for the songs I’m working on, and then create a Smart Reminder about them so I don’t forget to review those notes next time I’m in the home studio.</p><h3 id="ulysses-for-all-creative--open-ended-writing">Ulysses: for all creative / open-ended writing</h3><p><strong><a href="http://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a></strong> has become my ultimately creative scratchpad. Lyric ideas, blog post topics, sketches for a book I may write. The beauty of Ulysses is that it allows for endless organization, reorganization, merging, splitting and impeccable Markdown formatting of text.</p><p>In my workflow, this app (and how I use it) is especially important because <strong>it ONLY contains creative writing</strong>: blog drafts, lyrics, ideas for novel or album concepts, etc. I don’t get distracted by other life stuff when I have Ulysses open full-screen on my Mac or iPhone (like right now as I write this!), so I can actually focus on finishing that song or</p><p>Ulysses’ new iPhone app is totally invaluable, too, so I can do any of the above on the go. I didn’t at first value this since I typically need a keyboard for writing lots of text quickly - but now I can easily review my writing and rework snippets of it anywhere I like, without having to wait.</p><h3 id="trello-for-all-collaborative-work">Trello: for all collaborative work</h3><p><strong><a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a></strong> is everything collaborative. Now that Trello’s iOS app is just as solid as it’s beautiful web interface (and I can jump across either via Handoff) I can easily share ideas with my collaborators or comment on theirs. I rely on this for mixing/mastering my music with my friend James, planning trips with Alicia and building apps with some of my NYC friends.</p><p>Thanks to Smart Reminders, I can also reference any board or card on a Reminders list and quickly jump back to it later. For instance, if James sends me a new mix via Trello comment, I can pull it up via push notification and then immediately tell Siri to remind me about it next time I can give it a serious listen.</p><h3 id="pause-for-focus-switching-and-relaxation">Pause: for focus-switching and relaxation</h3><p><strong>Pause</strong> is one of those mindfulness apps, and I’m experimenting with it in my creative workflow. It’s allowing me to clear my head of the other life noise by just relaxing my motor functions before jumping into a recording session, new blog post or brain dump. I usually use it for a few seconds before jumping straight into a new context.</p><hr /><p>I used to think that over-organizing my life was necessary in order to achieve what I wanted to do creatively - but all I ended up with was tasks on tasks on tasks, multi-tier prioritization systems and even a literal Gantt chart at one point. All I needed was an easy way to see what was most important at any given time for a particular context, be able to act on it easily and without distraction, and discipline myself to switch contexts mindfully. This system seems to be working out well for me - let’s see how it works out over time.</p><h1 id="eight-months-in-an-office">Eight months, in an office</h1><p>10 months ago, I was living what I thought was a dream: working remotely for a decently-buzzed tech startup where I was the lead product guy. I could work in my underwear, start and end whenever I wanted, have free reign to work and travel wherever I pleased.</p><p>Then in May, said startup <a href="http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2015/05/21/custommade-will-continue-after-wayfair-hires-staff-ceo-leaves/">laid me (and pretty much everyone else) off with a week’s notice</a>.</p><p>I had seen this coming for almost a year for various reasons I won’t get into - but what did surprise me was the ease of getting back on my financial feet. <a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/05/21/boston-e-commerce-wayfair-acquisition-saves-custommade-jobs/">Those of us who got laid off were offered a new job pretty quickly by Wayfair</a>, an e-commerce giant also based in Boston. So that’s where I ended up.</p><p>Eight months later, I find myself finally in my element again. The first three months in this job were <strong>total culture shock</strong>: I was uncomfortable around so many people, all of them wanting to talk to me all about the work and nothing but the work. I was frustrated with having to commute to an office at all, let alone walking down the street like I would regularly do in New York.</p><p>But over the last few months, I figured out a rhythm to make it work for me. It’s certainly not a perfect situation - but then again, what job is, really? - but I’ve had some time to reflect about being in an office again.</p><h2 id="disclaimer-this-is-primarily-about-the-experience-of-working-in-an-office-environment-particularly-after-a-stint-in-startup-culture-and-is-in-no-way-intended-to-be-a-reflection-of-the-work-i-do-or-my-employer-at-all"><em>(Disclaimer: this is primarily about the experience of working in an office environment, particularly after a stint in startup culture, and is in no way intended to be a reflection of the work I do, or my employer, at all.)</em></h2><p>Wayfair employs thousands of people and has an office right next to Copley Square in Boston. When you walk into the office for the first time, it’s hard to not feel like you’re part of something massive, given just how many people are flocking to the Copley Plaza complex between 8 and 9am. You’d think one of the stores in the Copley Plaza Mall was having a blowout - nope, these are just Wayfair employees trudging into work.</p><p>After a few weeks, though, the awe of big company size and impact turns into drone-like fatigue…especially as wintertime sets in. Droves of sleepy, freezing employees passing through subway turnstiles, huddling underneath half-broken umbrellas and avoiding puddles of slush (and being forced above ground to avoid MBTA construction), just to stare at a PC screen and talk in corporate-speak.</p><p><strong>Simply having to be at the mercy of weather sucks.</strong> When I was working from home, if it was snowing out, I could just stay inside. I technically have the facilities to work from home in my current job, too - so it can be frustrating to eschew all this technological capability just to be present in the office culture. Wayfair has offices in several locations around the US and Europe; I can’t tell you how many times I questioned my battling of snowstorms to get into the office, only to sit on calls with my Berlin colleagues all day.</p><p>That said, if you’re stuck on calls all day at home, you might never leave the house. Get this: <strong>working in an office forces you out into the world</strong>. This is something I completely took for granted as a remote worker - I would occasionally run out to a coffee shop for a while to get stuff done, but nothing was more comforting than parking it on my couch for 9 hours straight save bathroom and lunch breaks.</p><p>Speaking of which, when you begin to compare home-work and office-work life, tiny subtle details start to surface about your lifestyle. For instance, <strong>The cost of your utilities</strong> start to become something you scrutinize monthly - I drastically underestimated how much I was spending to run electricity and heat during the ’14-’15 winter while working at home. <strong>Finding food to eat in an office is a really hit-or-miss thing, depending on where your office (or home) is located.</strong> I have the benefit of being right near Copley Square, where food trucks and solid restaurants abound. My last office job was in an awkward part of East Cambridge, MA, where our best culinary options were in a mall food court. At home, you’re really at the mercy of your grocery list or what (if any) restaurants are nearby; back in NYC, this wasn’t a problem, but in quieter parts of the world, this could certainly be a drawback.</p><p>Everyone who Product Manages knows the difficulty of trying to herd cats - oops, I mean colleagues - toward a shared product vision, and this difficulty is only amplified when doing it from afar. <strong>Being in the office ensures presence from everyone who matters, including my/yourself.</strong> I find myself more productive overall, simply because I had face time with colleagues working on projects with me - and no at-home distractions, like my guitars or my television. I can also use my commute to <strong>unwind and/or focus</strong> on things I’d never be able to focus on given those distractions. I’ve started writing again simply because I have over an hour of “free time” on the train every day.</p><p><strong>Working in an office can be painfully social.</strong> To avoid talking only about the work, you need to find common interests with your colleagues: in Boston, it’s generally assumed that this is Boston sports. If you’re not actively following the Bruins/Pats/Sox (or worse yet, following another city’s team) you’re already at a disadvantage. I’ve come to develop a personal brand around <a href="http://brandonlucasgreen.com/in-defense-of-miley-cyrus-her-dead-petz/">music snobbery,</a> pop culture savvy and a more casual tone, which people seem to appreciate outside of my general apathy for sports.</p><p>Once you figure your general vibe out, though, **working in an office can be delightfully social. **You actually start to make friends and engage in social conversations and outings you never would’ve had sitting at home or in a coffee shop all day long. Sure, there’s spontaneity involved with serendipitously meeting new people at your local coffee shop, but there’s something equally spontaneous in the side conversations that happen at work. My aforementioned music snobbery may manifest itself during a discussion of weekend plans, which may lead to a colleague/friend to check out a band with.</p><p><strong>And what happens when the work gets to be too much,</strong> and you find yourself stuck at the office all day? Isn’t that the beauty of working wherever you choose? What about those giant cultish companies who directly incentivize their employees to spend all waking hours at the office, or even <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/inside-google-workplaces-from-perks-to-nap-pods/">sleep there</a>?</p><h2 id="well-so-you-can-just-leave-if-theres-more-work-to-be-done-and-your-company-has-a-vpn-you-can-catch-up-on-work-at-home-after-having-a-lovely-dinner-at-a-reasonable-hour-with-your-significant-other-ive-come-to-realize-again-the-importance-of-balance---not-necessarily-the-lofty-unattainable-worklife-balance-construct-of-9-5-but-finding-a-personal-balance-where-im-challenging-myself-and-working-hard-but-not-burning-myself-out-and-still-finding-time-to-reflect-and-find-fulfillment-elsewhere-in-my-life">Well, so, you can just leave. If there’s more work to be done, and your company has a VPN, you can catch up on work at home after having a lovely dinner at a reasonable hour with your significant other. I’ve come to realize (again) <strong>the importance of balance</strong> - not necessarily the lofty, unattainable “work/life balance” construct of 9-5, but finding a personal balance where I’m challenging myself and working hard, but not burning myself out and still finding time to reflect and find fulfillment elsewhere in my life.</h2><p>Certain parts of the tech/startup industry paint office culture as a thing of the past, rendered unnecessary by new collaboration technology. Fully-distributed organizations are popping up everywhere, promising uber flexibility and balance. I admire these companies’ ability to embrace technology to try and bring more happiness to their employees - though <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/229011">it is certainly not perfect</a> either. Remember that distributed companies (or remote work at all) is a fairly new concept, far from perfected by any one organization - and the larger the company is that you work for, the harder it is to adapt the necessary processes and technology to enable that flexibility.</p><p>All in all? I certainly don’t hate everything. My commute is sometimes frustrating, as can be the work, but that’s part of dealing with everyday life. I genuinely like quite a few of my colleagues (both in and outside of work), which after being remote for a while is quite refreshing. And I’ve achieved a balance that, at least for now, I’m happy with.</p><p>The question I now find myself asking more frequently is: <strong>where does this go?</strong> Do I advance up the food chain of a strong brand with its corporate quirks, or do I keep my hand in some things that could result in more personal freedom? What will ultimately make me a better, happier person?</p><p>Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IA5Cv_5-g8">how many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop</a>?</p><h1 id="tracking-technology-and-the-vote">Tracking technology and the vote</h1><p><em>I originally wrote this for the ￼Mathys+Potestio￼ blog, this really cool employment agency based in Portland, Oregon. ￼<a href="http://mathys-potestio.com/tracking-social-technology-voter-engagement/">Here’s￼ the link</a> to the original post.</em></p><p>I’ve noticed that, for the first time in my life, I’m overwhelmed by politics. In high school, it was just a topic that sometimes came up among my debate-team friends. In college and my early years of employment it was a side conversation.</p><p>Now I can’t go a day without someone mentioning a candidate at least 3 times, and my Facebook news feed is covered almost exclusively in images, GIFs and video clips lampooning or praising candidates. Maybe I’m just at that age now when we begin to center conversations around politics unlike when we were young. Maybe it’s all media buzz. Maybe, even if it’s overwhelming, it’s actually a good thing: <a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0781453.html">voter turnout since 2008 is up from where it was in the 90s</a>.</p><p>Regardless, I find myself asking the question more frequently: <strong>why are so many of my friends and colleagues suddenly in tune with the election?</strong> What changed to make this a central part of our lives again?</p><p>You could easily argue that the trying times we live in begets political action in itself - but during every time of significant political activity in American history, technology seemed to come along for the ride. Think about the 1960 Presidential debates, during which technology (that is, television) presented candidates in a wholly new light: everyday people could <strong>truly see</strong> the candidates in person for the first time. This almost single-handedly swung the election in favor of the younger, more energized JFK - it gave apathetic or indecisive voters a new context in which they could base a political stance.</p><p>After the major TV broadcast networks got stale in terms of their political coverage, other players started to get involved. During the 80s we saw niche Cable television networks spring up everywhere covering virtually every popular interest. MTV found an opportunity to politically engage its audience in the early 2000s with <em>Vote or Die</em>, a campaign run by Puff Daddy aimed at young popular music fans to get out the vote. Had cable television never come to be, enabling specialty networks like MTV, that would never have happened.</p><p>Of course, <em>Vote or Die</em> is <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/04/25/is-diddy-vote-or-die-dead-or-just-sleeping.html">basically dead and gone at this point</a>, but that’s only because the idea also went stale. In a <a href="https://benjaminstudebaker.com/2014/11/04/the-case-against-voting/">blog post written before the 2014 midterm elections</a>, Benjamin Studebaker suggested that “when P-Diddy tells young people to vote or die, he can give all sorts of reasons why millions of young people should vote, but no reason why any given person should vote.” People were able to easily ignore the message on an individual level - while strong in tone, it falls flat. However, “there are many ways to get the influence you need to make a difference” - Studebaker doesn’t necessarily fault the program or any candidate tactic, per se - but perhaps a more intimate connection with voters to clearly understand and respond to concerns was the next place to go.</p><p>While <em>Vote or Die</em> was briefly capturing the attention of America’s youth, Facebook was plotting its eventual cultural takeover. Facebook feels like it’s been around forever at this point, but its influence on social behavior and pop culture is obvious; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/government-and-politics-on-facebook/facebook-politics-live-first-presidential-debate/10151026483095882/">just 8 years later, it hosted its first Town Hall meeting</a>. This was yet another way for disengaged citizens (specifically, younger, tech-savvy ones) to engage with politics and find reasons to vote. The rapid expansion of the social media space has introduced yet more interactive solutions for candidates to interact with potential or apathetic voters - for example, <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/digitalmarketing/social-media/how-periscope-will-be-key-to-a-2016-presidential-victory/">every candidate in the 2016 election has Instagram, Periscope and Snapchat accounts</a>, and their marketing teams are finding new ways to leverage these platforms to interact with young voters.</p><h2 id="technological-and-cultural-innovation-has-quite-literally-given-apathetic-citizens-new-reasons-to-vote-by-presenting-new-contexts-on-which-to-base-voting-decisions"><strong>Technological and cultural innovation has, quite literally, given apathetic citizens new reasons to vote</strong> by presenting new contexts on which to base voting decisions.</h2><p>If social tech is hugely influencing my network to get out and vote, is it affecting the same change in other demographics throughout the country? Are fervent Trump supporters in the Midwest endlessly posting about their fervent Trump support to their friends, like how my friends are nonstop blabbing about their liberalism? Software is eating the world, and the world has a smartphone and a Facebook account, so why don’t I see this?</p><p>Much of it has to do with context-setting, and much of that can be done by friends and family. In 2010, a <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2012/09/12/get-out-the-friend-vote-how-facebook-spurred-340000-extra-votes-in-2010/">single Facebook message got over 300,000 people to vote</a> because that message got stuck in a viral loop - the original writer shared the message to his closest friends, who then shared the message with their own friends, and so on. In the past 2 years, <a href="http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/facebooks-influence-impact-voter-turnout/207610">various people have speculated on Facebook’s massive direct impact on voter turnout</a>. Facebook’s audience tends to skew younger and female, so the impact on voter turnout is naturally felt most in these demographics. There are also plenty of businesses out there whose sole purpose is to thrive on “viral” content - and some of them, like Upworthy, focus on the most viral content with a meaningful underlying message. These topics also generally skew more liberal - perfect for the young, predominantly female audience on Facebook and other networks on which this content is shared.</p><p>But it’s fairly obvious that social networks have also had their negative effects on the political process - namely, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/08/disrupting-democracy/">they’ve encouraged polarization and filtered confirmation bias</a>.</p><p>That begs two questions:</p><ol><li>As social media hype starts to lose its luster in the face of content overload and social upheaval, what is the next technological advance that affects the political participation?</li><li>How does technology encourage voter turnout within those who are generally more resistant to technological change?</li></ol><p>I certainly can’t answer either of these questions today - but some startups are exploring them now. Startups like <a href="https://theagora.co/">Agora</a> and <a href="https://civisanalytics.com/">Civis Analyics</a> are working to <a href="http://www.inc.com/ilan-mochari/7-startups-that-will-change-election-day.html">bring better opportunities for voters to engage with their candidates, and better data to those candidates</a> such that they can reach out to untapped audiences. Perhaps that’s the next major area of innovation that will affect the vote - rather than presenting the candidates in different ways to the voter, reconfigure how the voter and candidate interact. Elsa Sze, founder of Agora, positions the platform <a href="http://bostinno.streetwise.co/2015/10/14/harvard-innovation-lab-startup-agora-offers-online-political-platform/">as a means to a voice every day</a>: live streaming town hall meetings that anyone can set up at any time, publicly-accessible Q&amp;As, detailed insights for officials. It makes sense, given our current sociocultural landscape, driven by interactivity and choice and media over-saturation; what’s better than being able to easily target your perfect voter and engage in a wholly two-sided, honest dialogue with him or her?</p><p>Only time will tell how these advances affect how citizens engage (or not) in our political process. The challenge (as many have mentioned when attempting to disrupt the political process) is adoption - <strong>how do you engage reluctant citizens while also providing new value to candidates and their supporters?</strong> How do you provide meaningful connections that influence positive social and political change while still capturing an increasingly distracted public’s attention?</p><p>Questions aside, it’s hard to deny that, regardless how directly technology is aiming to disrupt the vote, changes in each go hand in hand. I’m curious to see how, in the modern political landscape, how new advances in app development, virtual/augmented reality, hyper-local social networking, and political science bring voter turnout to its next natural progression.</p><h1 id="its-a-glorious-day-when-apple-fixes-your-bug">It’s a glorious day when Apple fixes your bug</h1><p>It takes a minor miracle to get Apple to fix a bug in any of its software or services. Just look at all the discussion threads on their forum.</p><p>The thing that’s been killing me for months? <strong>Dumb Smart Reminders.</strong> Apple claimed that, in iOS 9 and OS X El Capitan, you’d be able to remind yourself about virtually anything on your device - a note, a text message, a Trello card, a file on your FTP server - and the reminder would be saved with a simple contextual link for quick access.</p><p>Problem is, it’s been categorically broken. Ironically enough, it’s broken when you try to use your phone in the way Apple keeps pushing us to use it - through Siri’s (admittedly mostly great) voice recognition.</p><p>If you wanted to remind yourself about a website you were viewing on your phone, and you decided to use Siri to do that, Reminders would (sometimes) create a link correctly to Safari. If you happened to have another app installed on your phone at all (in my case, Ticketmaster, Google Chrome and TripAdvisor), Reminders would <em>instead</em> link to one of those apps - then if I tried to access the website, iOS would attempt to open Ticketmaster and fail to render the website.</p><p>Argh.</p><p>It wouldn’t have been as infuriating if this was only an issue on iOS - but of course it happened in OS X too. If I saved the same website to Reminders on my Mac using Safari, for some reason, Reminders would instead create a link to Chrome. This wasn’t <strong>as</strong> bad - at least the site would load - but when you’re like me and strictly use your web browsers for specific reasons (eg. Safari for personal, Chrome for work), this gets annoying.</p><p>The worst part, though, was that I could totally see what was happening: if I uninstalled TripAdvisor from my iPhone, Reminders would stop linking to it - but instead link to Ticketmaster. Then it’d link to Chrome if I uninstalled Ticketmaster. If I reinstalled TripAdvisor, it’d start linking there again. Basically, Reminders would work without any other apps potentially risking the link to Safari. You’d think that Apple coded this such that Reminders was aware of the source app of the Reminder, and persisted that link forever. There was some dumb app prioritization happening that was causing TripAdvisor to take preference over Ticketmaster, which got preference over Chrome, which got preference over Safari. <em>(No offense to any of these apps, they’re all great - which is why I have them on my phone, god damnit.)</em></p><p>So, while I wanted to use Reminders for <strong>exactly what Apple intended it for</strong>, I couldn’t, and had to rely on another (admittedly great, but not for me) <a href="http://2doapp.com">app, 2Do, to manage my tasks</a>.</p><hr /><p>Six days ago <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/07/apple-seeds-ios-9-3-beta-6/">Apple released the sixth <em>(sixth!)</em> public beta</a> of iOS 9.3. Yesterday morning, I got frustrated because I was duplicating task lists for my upcoming wedding in both Trello and 2Do - so I decided to try out Reminders again. Saving Trello cards as a Reminder seemed to work. Saving a Note seemed to work. Reminding myself about something in my Amazon wish list worked. Even a stupid webpage someone had sent me went correctly into a Reminders list.</p><p>Yesterday was a glorious day.</p><h1 id="google-sometimes-drops-the-ball-because-google-is-a-massive-company">Google sometimes drops the ball because Google is a massive company</h1><p>The other day I finally subscribed to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/connected">Connected</a>, a great consumer tech podcast, and in their most recent episode, <a href="http://twitter.com/viticci">Federico</a> rants about the inconsistent feature support across Google’s iOS apps. (He <a href="https://www.macstories.net/linked/googles-second-class-ipad-pro-apps/">ranted about it 2 months prior</a>, and the <a href="https://apple.news/A-cqF7mjVP-CAI5L6wRShNg">rant still stands</a>.) They’ve failed to provide consistent support for now-core iPad features, including support for the iPad Pro’s bigger screen and Split View. How can you write in Google Docs and do research simultaneously without split view?</p><p>Not even being sarcastic. <strong>I have to imagine it’s really annoying and hard.</strong> If I had an iPad Pro, I’d probably agree with him; in fact I’d probably stop using those apps altogether until Google made them work for me. It sucks even more to notice that Google has updated <em>some</em> of their apps with support for these features. But why not the others, arguably the ones that are the most widely used purely in a productivity context?</p><p>I was listening to his rant on my way into work - a place of work where I am one of over 4,000 employees. I started thinking about the different projects that are in flight at any given time within my company and reminded myself: I have no idea who is held accountable for some of those projects. <strong>Who knows if they have the same priorities that I do?</strong> In just nine months at my current company, I’ve had to deal with multiple fits and starts around projects that involved multiple key teams, only to find out that those teams suddenly had to prioritize these same projects completely differently than mine, due to other external factors beyond my control.</p><p>Google is an even more massive organization. It has over 10,000 employees working on any number of products or initiatives. There are teams of hundreds dedicated to Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Drive, even just the different iterations of messaging (Hangouts &amp; Voice &amp; Chat across all platforms). Each of those teams contain different people, each with strengths and weaknesses and a certain propensity to work harder or less hard than others, or even make occasional mistakes. They also may have different priorities, backlogs and possibly even internal politics.</p><p><strong>We have to remind ourselves that each of these factors may translate into different results per product.</strong> I would bet that Drive (which coincidentally I think is one of the best Google apps on iOS) has a lot more of its core functionality together and had the capacity to fit split-view support into its roadmap shortly after it was announced. Docs (or more specifically, Docs for iOS) is probably run by a different team that still hasn’t been able to prioritize one of these features. Or perhaps they have it built and in a testing phase, but some QA analyst ran into a massive, crippling bug that Spilt View caused in Docs for iOS but was not a problem in the other iOS apps. Maybe there’s another feature they’ve been pushing for that took precedence over Split View or caused a UX problem when rendering on the larger iPad Pro screen.</p><p>Remember when <a href="https://plus.google.com/+google/posts/9YVKGgozyV3">Google+ finally got its Material Design update for iOS almost a year after it did for Android</a>, even after people declared it dead? Why does the Google Analytics, one of the most widely used Google business tools, have a <a href="Why%20does%20the%20Google%20Analytics,%20one%20of%20the%20most%20widely%20used%20">terrible iOS app with an outdated icon and no 6+ screen support</a>? When was the last time anyone tried out <a href="http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/07/31/apples-ios-7-3d-maps-leave-google-earth-nokia-3d-maps-looking-old-fashioned">Google Earth for iOS</a>? Did you even know that <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-street-view/id904418768?mt=8">Google has a dedicated Street View app</a> separate from Google Maps? Who decided to make that?</p><p><img src="#" />(http://i2.wp.com/brandonlucasgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Google-Drive-vs.-Google-Earth-both-in-2016.jpeg?fit=1200%2C1067 “Drive vs. Earth, 2016”)</p><p>These apps are different priorities for different teams under the same friendly Google brand, so we can’t be surprised when their adoption of features or design principles aren’t totally consistent.</p><p>Managing a product roadmap is hard. Managing a roadmap for a single product that plays nice with the roadmaps of other products under a single company is exponentially harder. As frustrating as it can be to see individual products under a brand fall behind others, it’s worth reminding ourselves about these difficulties - especially with amazing new features on which we rely in some contexts of our daily lives.</p><h1 id="moving-to-ios-an-experiment-in-creative-restraint">Moving to iOS: an experiment in creative restraint</h1><p>On Monday I’m receiving a company laptop. I have mixed feelings about this - it inevitably and subliminally will have me working more on trains and on weekends, but I’ll be able to do so much faster than I currently do via Microsoft Remote Desktop.</p><p>Why do I bring this up? I bring this up because I have a beautiful, expensive Retina MacBook Pro that I’ve been using for the bulk of all my work for almost 3 years. It’s my indispensable sidekick for recording music, writing, (attempts at) coding, managing my finances, pretty much everything. Since starting my current job, though, I’ve started to spend less and less time with it - occasionally pulling it out on crowded trains, opportunistically pushing it to its limits by recording for hours at a time on weekends, painstakingly RDP-ing into my work machine just to run a few SQL queries. Sometimes it sits on a desk for days at a time, neglected.</p><p>Now that I’m getting this other laptop, I have even less use for the thing.</p><p>I have an iPad Air 2 - this thing is also generally neglected in my household. <a href="http://laviecreative.co">Alicia</a> will occasionally use it to watch TV in bed, and I’ll occasionally check Twitter or read some blogs with it, but that’s about it. I had downloaded Ulysses for iOS a few months back thinking I could use this iPad as a blogging machine, but even that felt redundant with the MacBook Pro.</p><p>I realized, however, that the work laptop has given me an opportunity to change the way I work outside of my day job a bit. After reading about the amazing power in the new iPads and the app potential brought by iOS 9, I’ve decided to run some day-to-day experiments using the iPad Air 2 in attempting to make it my primary computer.</p><p><img alt="The iPad does not replace coffee." src="http://i1.wp.com/brandonlucasgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/iPad-does-not-replace-coffee.jpeg?fit=800,600" /></p><p><strong>There’s already been a ton of writing on this</strong> - I’m really happy to have dug into the writings on iPad on <a href="http://macstories.net">MacStories</a>, <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, the <a href="http://musicappblog.com">Music App Blog</a> and other sites, so I have plenty of foundational ideas to work with. I’m interested in seeing how I can leverage my iPad for my personal use cases:</p><ul><li>rapid blogging in <a href="http://ulyssesapp.com">Ulysses</a>,</li><li>music recording in <a href="http://auriaapp.com">Auria Pro</a> with a plethora of synth/sampler/effects apps wired together via <a href="http://audiob.us">Audiobus</a>,</li><li>pseudo-local website development with <a href="http://workingcopyapp.com">Working Copy</a>, <a href="https://panic.com/coda-ios/">Coda</a> and <a href="https://panic.com/transmit-ios/">Transmit</a>,</li><li>managing my music, technical and personal projects with <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> and various stock iOS apps</li></ul><p>…and I’m sure many more along the way. I’m mainly interested in testing just how portable my tech can be and moving to a single operating system (that is, iOS), but I’m also curious as to what new possibilities there are brought by the iOS framework and app ecosystem.</p><p>More to come. I should probably start getting used to this tiny keyboard…</p><h1 id="ios-experiment-1-changing-and-tinkering-with-a-wordpress-site-theme">iOS experiment 1: changing and tinkering with a Wordpress site theme</h1><p>As I <a href="http://brandonlucasgreen.com/moving-to-ios-an-experiment-in-creative-restraint/">mentioned last week</a>, I’m trying to make my iPad Air 2 actually useful in my life. Currently, it’s a rarely used content portal despite being almost as powerful as my MacBook Pro and having a fantastic app ecosystem.</p><p>Plenty of folks have talked about the beauty of being able to code on an iPad - there’s apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/coda/id500906297?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010laBV">Coda</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/textastic-code-editor-6/id1049254261?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010laBV">Textastic</a> that have been germinating for years in the App Store - but there’s so much more to web &amp; software development than just writing code. You need a local development environment. You need to be able to manage changes to your code via Git or Subversion. You need to be able to show people real changes before pushing those changes to your live site or app. You need to be able to read and manipulate data. There’s plenty more I can’t even think of, since - hey now - I’m not actually a full-time developer.</p><p>That said, I manage a few sites built in self-hosted <a href="http://wordpress.org">Wordpress</a>, one of which is this site. I got tired of having to find and fix bugs with the old theme, so I wanted to see if I could simply change a theme and hack it to my liking, all via my iPad.</p><h3 id="why-is-this-not-so-intuitive-to-the-untrained-eye">Why is this not so intuitive to the untrained eye?</h3><p>Wordpress has an amazing theme directory of its own, which allows for direct installs to your website; plus there are thousands of premium theme repositories across the Internet which package beautiful themes in nice .zip packages, which can be extracted easily within your hosting environment for use. I’ve been doing this for years and it’s second nature at this point to launch a Wordpress site and tinker with countless themes. However, this is a bit harder to do on iOS:</p><ul><li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wordpress/id335703880?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010laBV">Wordpress’ iOS app</a> has no awareness of its own theme directory;</li><li>There’s no true in-house file management solution in iOS;</li><li>iOS’ handling of .zip files in itself is murky at best;</li><li>There’s no obvious way to set up a local environment of your Wordpress site on iOS to tinker with the theme before pushing it live</li></ul><p>So, how should we deal with this?</p><h3 id="finding-and-getting-a-new-theme">Finding and getting a new theme</h3><p>As I mentioned before, it’s really easy to find Wordpress themes on the Internet - just Google it. When I find a theme I like, I need to download the .zip file containing its assets and somehow get it onto my hosting platform.</p><p>I’ve come to really appreciate <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/documents-5-fast-pdf-reader/id364901807?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010laBV">Readdle’s Documents app</a> for all my file downloads and management. It has its own built-in browser, which handles file downloads much more seamlessly than Safari’s stock file handling. I’ve found that some Wordpress theme providers require a login to access a theme’s files (ThemeForest, for example), so having Documents for both the logged-in experience on one of these sites and the downloads I need to perform is really helpful. I can then open up and look at the files within Documents, and upload them straight to my FTP server provided by my hosting provider - all within Documents.</p><h3 id="testing-the-theme-out">Testing the theme out</h3><p>Web &amp; software developers commonly refer to a ‘local’ environment for making changes to their code &amp; testing those changes. I haven’t yet found a good way to do this all directly on my iOS device; however, with websites, it’s pretty easy to set up a private sandbox to test out new themes before pushing them to my live site.</p><p>I use <a href="http://namecheap.com">Namecheap</a> for both my domains and shared hosting; they give me a pretty robust SFTP server to host all my files for my websites. I’ve set up my 3 main websites to point to this server, as well as 3 “sandboxed” versions of those websites in a subdirectory - /sandbox/brandonlucasgreen/, for example. In that folder is another Wordpress install which is private to the world and only accessible to me, which I set up simply through the cPanel interface. Setting up a new Wordpress install in iOS Safari isn’t quite as speedy as it is on my MacBook Pro, but it’s not terribly hard to get done.</p><p>What <strong>doesn’t</strong> work well on a 9.7“ screen is Wordpress.com’s stock post editor. <img src="http://i2.wp.com/brandonlucasgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ipad-wordpress-admin.jpeg?fit=640,480" /></p><p>Thank goodness for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses-mobile/id950335311?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010laBV">Ulysses</a>, which is so much more pleasant to look at, extremely good at organizing my writing (both long- and extremely short-form), and can get my posts to Wordpress via a simple <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010laBV">Workflow</a>.<span data-nosnippet=""><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup></span> <img src="http://i1.wp.com/brandonlucasgreen.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ulysses-on-ipad.jpeg?fit=640,480" /></p><p>Having a sandbox to break things within is great, but I also wanted to try some sort of revision management on the iPad.

Wordpress operates on MySQL, and I’ve found that <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/navicat-for-mysql-your-mobile/id688128940?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010laBV">Navicat’s MySQL client</a> for iOS is a solid app for dealing with this.</h2><p>This is just a start, but after messing around with a few apps and getting comfortable with a smaller screen, I’m reasonably confident that I can manage my website entirely from an iPad. Next up: working with audio on an ipad.</p><h1 id="ios-experiment-evaluating-mixes">iOS experiment: evaluating mixes</h1><p>I haven’t written in a bit, but here’s some more stuff I’ve been thinking about in my spare time: listening to my music projects-in-progress in as many possible contexts as I can.</p><p>Why is this more than a simple task? Audio files are big. Important: these are not your favorite streaming service’s audio files. These are hi-res, uncompressed, 24-to-32-bit audio files that are being semi-professionally mixed and mastered by a sound engineer for me. I can’t stream these without murdering my data plan, and there’s no easy or obvious way to put all these files I listen to within the stock iOS ecosystem. Plus, I need to manage and track changes to mixes easily as we address notes about those mixes.</p><h3 id="issue-1-managing-the-recording-project">issue 1: managing the recording project</h3><p>I use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trello/id461504587?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010laBV">Trello</a> for all my recording projects currently, and their iOS apps are pretty fantastic and getting new and more complex features monthly. So no issues here.</p><h3 id="issue-2-getting-the-mix">issue 2: getting the mix</h3><p>When James, my mixing/mastering engineer friend, has a mix for me, he usually posts a comment on Trello with the private S3 download link. I love how easy it is to just spin up a mix for listening, but this gets problematic when I’m on the go. I listen to a lot of music (including these mixes) on trains to and from work - streaming a 50-200 MB audio file is murder to my data plan, and way too slow for any meaningful listening.</p><p>So I need to download to my phone as soon as I get James’ mix. I’ve come to really appreciate <strong><a href="http://readdle.com/documents">Readdle Documents</a></strong> as my storage system for audio files, or any files, really. Documents has the ability to auto-sync any folder from any major cloud service. James (my mixing engineer) and I primarily rely on <strong>Google Drive</strong> and <strong>Amazon S3</strong> as our main repositories for managing and sharing files around our music projects; Google Drive’s got some nice revision history tracking that allow us to keep track of what’s changed in a particular file or session. I can dump any of James’ mixes into a Google Drive folder, and in less than 20 seconds, it’s on my phone ready for offline listening.</p><p>Amazon S3 is a different beast, though - we use it primarily for large session storage and archiving - but I still occasionally need to access that on the go. Panic’s excellent <strong><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/transmit/id917432930?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010laBV">Transmit</a></strong> app makes browsing S3 buckets super easy, and it’s beautiful on my iPhone 6s Plus. Frankly, if Panic built Google Drive support and some local file sync support into the app, I’d probably use Transmit exclusively for all file management on iOS.</p><h3 id="issue-3-mix-notes">issue 3: mix notes</h3><p>As I mentioned above, we use Trello to manage the recording project at a high level. But sometimes I’ll be listening to a mix on the go and get a quick idea that I want to write down. Apple’s stock Notes app, with 3D Touch, makes for really quick note-taking that I can access later from anywhere. I love the new checklist feature in Apple Notes, mainly because it’s nice to look at and super responsive.</p><p>If you don’t have an iPhone with 3D Touch, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1010laBV">Drafts</a> is an excellent alternative here. It’s super minimal and uses Markdown syntax to easily organize notes you take. You can even set up very custom share actions that allow you send your drafts anywhere in a swipe.</p><p>In either case, I can easily take notes on the fly and share them to James in Trello or whichever messaging app in which we’re talking.</p><hr /><p>That’s pretty much it. Not much to it, but I find it valuable to review how I perform more file-heavy, less-simple tasks with the constraints of iOS such that I can waste less time and have easier access to the projects I love working on.</p><h1 id="creative-work-on-an-ipad">Creative work on an iPad</h1><p>We all have smartphones. Some people even have a smartphone and/or a tablet in lieu of a computer.</p><p>The rest of us still rely on laptop or desktop computers, sometimes multiple, in our daily lives. My office is lined with ugly black desktop PCs sitting underneath thousands of desks, each with dual monitors attached. My mixing engineer relies on a souped-up PC to run massive Pro Tools sessions. My <a href="http://laviecreative.co">designer/photographer fiancée</a> pretty much lives in Adobe’s Creative Suite.</p><p>Since starting my current job, I’ve had some spare time to audit the devices I use in my daily life. While I still rely on my trusty Mac for recording and sequencing music ideas, I’m opening up to the idea of being more portable. I got an <strong>iPad Air 2</strong> a while ago which sat for months on a table, idle except for occasional bits where I decided to read an article on a bigger screen than my iPhone.</p><p>The iPad is a beautiful device, and rather than feel obligated to sell it, I tried using it for actual work - and (for the most part) it was a lovely experience. The smaller screen and ergonomics of having to touch the screen allow for <strong>less distractions</strong> and <strong>more fun, natural interaction</strong> with daily tasks and communication with my contacts. One might feel initially slower in their workflows when starting on an iPad as a result of this stuff - I know I did - but that in itself caused me to be switching between apps less, and focusing more.</p><p>The problems of the iPad are largely due to the nature of the software itself - for example, there’s no file system. You basically need a cloud storage solution (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.) to get one. It sounds like Apple may be trying to <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3083090/macs/icloud-drive-to-offer-optimized-storage-desktop-sharing.html">remedy this with their own solution</a>, but it’s a tough thing to get used to and is troubling for those working with many large files. Also, the smaller screen isn’t for everyone in a productivity context - some creative workers rely on their larger screens to make careful edits to their work or make sense of lots of content at once.</p><h2 id="hardware-you-dont-need-a-lot-of-it">Hardware: you don’t need a lot of it</h2><p>The iPad Air 2 is an amazing piece of hardware - and Apple has only improved upon it with the iPad Pro - but for lots of users, this isn’t enough. For starters, you only have one input jack - the Lightning adapter - which also is required for charging the thing. That is a clear limitation for those working with lots of hardware peripherals, like musicians and videographers. Don’t expect your external RAID storage or Thunderbolt interfaces from working in this context. However, there are some options here - like using a powered USB hub, which I’ll come back to in a bit - and many manufacturers are beginning to make iPad-friendly versions of their devices, like iOS-ready hard drives and audio interfaces.</p><p>Also, a touchscreen keyboard isn’t going to cut it for long-form writing or significant productivity. That’s probably why there is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?url=search-alias=aps&amp;field-keywords=ipad%20keyboard&amp;tag=a2appu-20">whole market dedicated to 3rd-party keyboards for iPad</a>, plus a whole host of other accessories to beef up your tablet game. I bought myself the solid, minimalist and affordable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Ultra-Slim-Keyboard-Comfortable-Low-Profile/dp/B00HAWW590/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465141926&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ipad+air+2keyboard+anker">Anker keyboard</a>, but there’s hundreds of options to match your typing habits and personal style.</p><p>There’s also a market for plenty of other iPad accessories - cases, stands, chargers are just a few things for which you can find hundreds of options. Generally, go for what fits your style; if the reviews are good, it’s probably a reliable product. The point: while you won’t have the sheer power and flexibility of several inputs on an iPad, you don’t need a lot of hardware to make your iPad useful.</p><h2 id="for-musicians">For musicians</h2><p>I’ve had a lovely, if not challenging, time making my iPad work for me musically. The learning curve is quite low, and while the possibilities aren’t endless there’s a bunch you can do, both for fun and for work.</p><p>Those who have recorded music on desktop and laptop computers know the possibilities regarding digital audio hardware. There are hundreds of audio interfaces available, with tons of inputs and outputs, various connectivity protocols (Thunderbolt being the newest), and more. With the iPad inevitably comes restrictions, but they’re surprisingly less than you’d think. With an <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD821AM/A/lightning-to-usb-camera-adapter">Apple Lightning-to-USB adapter</a> (the name doesn’t do this thing justice), you can hook up any USB-powered audio interface to your iPad. My personal favorite is the newest <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Ultra-Slim-Keyboard-Comfortable-Low-Profile/dp/B00HAWW590/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1465141926&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ipad+air+2keyboard+anker">Apogee Duet</a>, which is optimized for both Mac and iPad and has an extra USB out - this allows me to run both audio <em>and</em> a MIDI controller into my iPad Air 2. That said, there are still plenty of options to choose from - other popular favorites are the <a href="https://us.focusrite.com/usb-audio-interfaces/scarlett-2i2">Focusrite Scarlett 2i2</a> and the new <a href="https://global.novationmusic.com/accessories/audiohub-2x4">Novation Audiohub</a>, which bizarrely has no XLR ins/outs but has 3 USB outputs (perfect for iPad DJs).</p><p>Let’s go back to Lightning-to-USB for a second. Given that you only really have 1 USB input to work with on an iPad, your controller options are limited. This can be mitigated, however, through powered USB hubs or expansion-ready hardware. Personally, I haven’t yet found a powered USB hub that works 100% reliably with an iPad (though many have recommended this one before), but the possibilities brought upon by the Apogee Duet are interesting. I’m currently planning an experiment to daisy-chain controllers through the Duet, by using the new <a href="http://www.korg.com/us/products/controllers/microkey/">Korg Micro series</a> of controllers, the keyboard of which has additional USB outputs.</p><p>Now, onto software. If you search the App Store for musical instrument apps, or even effects apps, there’s a ton of them out there. Apple’s own Garageband app has plenty of music-making tools within for only $5. However, the most essential app I recommend to musicians experimenting with iOS devices is <strong>Audiobus</strong>. This thing is, by far, the best signal-routing solution for an iPad. You</p><p>Once Audiobus is set up on your iPad, you can expand quickly - they even have an app directory built in. Some of my favorite apps to use with Audiobus are:</p><ul><li><strong>Loopy HD</strong> - if you watch Jimmy Fallon’s show, you probably already know about this app, but it’s hands-down the best live looping solution I’ve ever had the privilege of using. I use this to write constantly, and will be incorporating it into my live performances in the near future.</li><li><strong>Auria Pro</strong> - this is the closest thing to a proper DAW on iPad.</li><li>Novation Launchpad</li><li>** iGrand Piano** - for piano-playing on the go. It’s a little pricey at $20, but it’s the best sounding piano I’ve found and is far quicker and easier to start up than opening up Logic or Reason from my Mac. Tap and go.</li><li><strong>DM1</strong> - this is my favorite drum machine for iPad. It has a surprisingly large set of drum machines to try out, plus a solid few acoustic drum samplers. Plus, it’s only $4.</li><li>Any Reason users out there? If so, check out <strong>Thor</strong>, which is the same amazing polyphonic synthesizer you know and love but in a smaller package.</li><li>The <strong>Holderness Media suite</strong> of effects apps are dead-simple, beautiful and cheap add-ons to your iPad music arsenal. My personal favorites are Echo Pad and Crystalline</li></ul><p>Last, but not least, dealing with audio files. If you’ve ever messed around with Garageband before, you know that the sharing options are limited: M4A-quality audio pushed to the iTunes Store, Apple Music Connect <em>(which, who cares, honestly?)</em> or SoundCloud. The aforementioned Auria Pro has the lovely capability of exporting WAV mixdowns of your works, but how do you get that out to collaborators or for public consumption? Here’s a few suggestions I have:</p><ul><li>Many iOS music apps have built-in <strong>Dropbox</strong> integration. I’ve found that Dropbox is a fabulous cloud storage solution for working with audio. If you don’t have or want to use Dropbox, however, iCloud or Google Drive should work fine, and the aforementioned Documents app can act as your central repository across all your cloud storage devices.</li><li>Need to quickly convert audio for sharing? There’s surprisingly an app for that - check out <strong>Audio Convert</strong>. It’s dead simple and dirty cheap.</li></ul><h2 id="for-writers">For writers</h2><p>Writing on an iPad is one of the most pleasant experiences I’ve had with technology lately. Sure, you can blog from your laptop - but the propensity for distraction is high, and much time can be wasted. I’ve come to realize that the ergonomics of an iPad - eschewing a trackpad immediately in reach in exchange for a touchscreen - allows me to focus more directly on writing; in order to switch contexts, I’d need to move my hands up to the screen.</p><p>What’s the best way to write on an iPad? Of course, there’s a ton of options. It sort of depends on your line of work. I mainly blog, write lyrics and occasionally sketch ideas for longer-form writing. For this, I prefer <strong>Ulysses</strong> - it’s pricey ($20), but it’s worth it. It gives you a full-on ecosystem for any writing you do, from note-taking to entire novels. There’s a ton of case studies on its use in a writer’s daily life, and they’re pretty compelling. Hey, I wrote this blog post using Ulysses!</p><p>Not ready to take that plunge? There are plenty of other options. <strong>Byword</strong> <strong>iA Writer</strong> and <strong>1Writer</strong> are all beautiful, solid options that don’t quite have the same organizational feature set as Ulysses, but are easy-to-use, powerful and beautiful on an iPad screen.</p><p>Alternatively, if you’re used to writing text to perform tasks more than for creative purposes, <strong>Drafts</strong> and <strong>Editorial</strong> are interesting (read: amazing) apps to explore. These apps let you write with nearly the same scope as the above options, but with additional scripting capabilities built in. Both apps allow you to easily share your texts to other apps in various contexts.</p><h2 id="for-artists--photographers-the-options-are-endless">For artists &amp; photographers: the options are endless</h2><p>Artists, designers and photographers have a whole host of apps to aid in their design workflow. Unlike the music space, the iPad lends itself well to visual artists on its own thanks to a beautiful touchscreen and new peripherals like the Apple Pencil.</p><p>Let’s talk about software then. I’m not a photographer or designer, but I have a need to tinker with visuals on an tablet occasionally. For this, I rely on <strong>Procreate</strong>, the pre-eminent drawing and coloring app for iPad, and <strong>Pixemator</strong>, a beautiful, surprisingly powerful Photoshop replacement.</p><p>Regarding photography apps, I will only say this: there are literally thousands of options here. From simple filters and effects to full-on photo retouching apps, there are plenty to try to your liking. I personally love Afterlight, Filters, VSCOcam, and (of course) Instagram.</p><p>Last, but certainly not least: for people familiar with <strong>Adobe’s</strong> ecosystem, most of their apps have an iOS counterpart. They’re not <em>quite</em> as powerful as their desktop counterparts, but if you’re on the go and need to make a quick edit, pull in your Creative Cloud files and Photoshop away. I personally love Adobe Photoshop Elements for iPad, and Lightroom is a solid counterpart to try as well (or at least my fiancée told me so).</p><h2 id="staying-productive">Staying productive</h2><p>Creative work still begets lots of day-to-day management of said work. Fortunately, the iPad can also be a productivity powerhouse thanks to beautiful and detailed task management, client management, mind mapping, and many more apps. Some of my favorites follow.</p><p>For task management, I can’t recommend highly enough <strong>2Do</strong> and <strong>Trello</strong>. The former is a highly customizable Apple Reminders replacement, and the latter is a more visual project management tool that I’ve been writing about for years. Anyone running a business or managing multiple projects should try these apps out. 2Do has a high price point, but frequently gets discounted; Trello is free with some nice business power ups.</p><p>For brainstorming, I like <strong>MindNode</strong> - it allows you to easily sketch out related ideas in a mind mapping framework and can easily take in text ideas from places like your Reminders.</p><p>Sometimes you have to do math, and sometimes you need to keep track of a lot of math around the same idea. For that, <strong>Soulver</strong> is amazing. It molds basic text and complex arithmetic into a framework that lets you perform calculations and annotate them in line, which is helpful for things like budgeting.</p><p>In virtually all lines of work, there are lots of files and documents to be managed. For this, I love Readdle’s <strong>Documents</strong> app. It integrates directly with virtually all cloud services, including FTP servers, lets you auto-sync files to your iOS devices, and even has a built in media player and PDF viewer. I love this thing for keeping track of mixes of my own songs-in-progress.</p><p>Sometimes you need your apps to talk to each other. This, for a while, was nearly impossible in iOS - however, two apps have made your apps (and data and content) more extensible than ever: <strong>Workflow</strong> and <strong>IFTTT</strong>. These two apps have done wonders for me (and millions of other people) to easily pass files, text, data and other content across many apps and manipulate it for pretty much any purpose. I won’t get too deep into either app, because the possibilities with both are massive; however, if you find yourself using more than a couple of apps daily, I highly recommend trying both apps out. I use Workflow daily for sharing content across multiple social networks, grabbing audio from the Internet, organizing my thoughts into coherent bundles, and more.</p><h2 id="productivity-simple-or-complex-to-your-liking">Productivity, simple or complex to your liking</h2><p>Let’s be honest: there are way too many apps in he iOS App Store. There are dozens of perfectly capable and powerful apps for all sorts of productivity needs. I’ve found countless times that, despite the souped-up functionality many 3rd-party apps provide to increase your productivity, you most likely waste more time optimizing and tweaking those apps that you end up <em>losing</em> time. This is a problem - and I’ve found the recommendations of a few trusted sources really valuable here.</p><p>Personally, I <strong>love</strong> Apple’s stock Mail, Calendar, Notes &amp; Reminders (as of iOS 9) to manage my day-to-day workflow of tasks, notes and email. Each of these apps have much more functionality than what appears on the surface:</p><ul><li>Trying to get your inbox under control? <strong>Mail</strong> gives you a nice set of Smart Folders to focus on only unread email, only emails from today, and more. You can also bring any mailbox or folder to the top-level with a simple few taps.</li><li><strong>Calendar</strong> is beautiful and it works. I don’t know about you, but I don’t need a different version of the same thing.</li><li><strong>Reminders</strong> is my top-level view of everything I need to do or worry about. Need a special view to see to-dos in a particular context? Just make another list for it. Or search your tasks for common keywords. You don’t need that super-special smart folder.<ul><li>Need to quickly change a due date? Got an iPhone 6s/6s Plus? 3D Touch your reminder. Just do that.</li><li>Need to remind yourself to check a website? Remind yourself about it via the Share extension in Safari…or pretty much any other app that allows for sharing. I rely on this thing daily to keep track of things I find during the day but want to revisit at night after work.</li><li>Need to remind yourself about a whole list of things? I’ve become incredibly reliant on <strong>Notes</strong> and <strong>Reminders</strong> in parallel. I’ll type up a note containing a bunch of information and checklists around something I need to do, and then add a Reminder for it via Siri.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Need something more for your email, tasks or notes? There’s a ton of options here, many of which you’re probably already using on your Mac. Evernote, Trello, Wunderlist, 2Do, Google’s suite of apps, Microsoft Office - each of these are amazing on the iPad, and worthy contenders for managing your creative projects and communication.</p><hr /><p>If technology has given us anything, it’s given us a ton of options for how we do things in our daily lives. That can be overwhelming, so anything one can do to control or constrain themselves is essential to retaining some sense of calm. I’ve found that working on an iPad forces a certain level of restriction, and I’ve been pleasantly surprised with the results so far.</p><h1 id="32-places-to-put-stuff">32 places to put stuff</h1><p>I have a lot of places in which I put things I care about.</p><p>I use <strong>Reminders</strong> to store…well, reminders of things I need to do. Basic lists. I have a wish list of stuff I want to buy on <strong>Amazon</strong>, but then I have another list of other non-Amazon stuff to buy in Reminders. I also have a few lists and notes for things in <strong>Apple Notes</strong>. I keep my passwords securely in <strong>1Password</strong>. I use <strong>Trello</strong> to manage projects, but not all projects because not everyone uses that. For some things, I need to make a <strong>Google Doc</strong> or <strong>Sheet</strong>. (Somehow, I’ve literally never had a need for a Google Slides presentation.) Sometimes those projects have other materials. If I’m collaborating, they get shoved into <strong>Google Drive</strong> or (occasionally) <strong>Dropbox</strong>. If it’s a personal project, it’s most likely <strong>iCloud Drive</strong>. If it’s something in Adobe’s ecosystem, it might end up in <strong>Adobe Creative Cloud</strong> - I barely ever use it, but sometimes things occasionally end up in there. I use <strong>Scanbot</strong> to scan papers, receipts and stuff for storage in one of these places If it’s a work thing, it goes to <strong>Sharepoint</strong> which also includes a hook into <strong>OneDrive</strong>. Sometimes it’s a manual or guide book for something, in which case it goes to <strong>iBooks</strong>, which is basically iCloud but also sort of not. Speaking of iCloud services and reading, <strong>Safari Reading List</strong> also houses some reading materials that I care about.</p><p>Photos can of course be stored in many places - it doesn’t really matter where they go as long as they’re everywhere all the time. In case they aren’t, well, they start in <strong>iCloud Photo Library</strong>, then go to <strong>Google Photos</strong> and <strong>Amazon Prime Photos</strong>.</p><p>All this stuff backs up to <strong>one of two external hard drives</strong>, and an <strong>Amazon S3 bucket.</strong></p><p>Sometimes I write. I like Markdown for my own personal writing, so I write lyrics, creative ideas and blog posts like this one in <strong>Ulysses</strong>. I can’t use that for my day job, though, so for that I use <strong>OneNote</strong> to write &amp; share notes &amp; documentation with my team. We use a proprietary solution for managing technical projects. Roadmap documents? <strong>Excel</strong> and <strong>Word</strong>. Not Trello, at least yet, because I need to get people to adopt it and we’re a pretty tight Microsoft shop. Speaking of which, <strong>Powerpoint</strong>. We still use <strong>Slack</strong> to communicate, and I use it for some other things. Sometimes I save notes and to-dos as starred Slack messages. Of course, there’s always stuff in <strong>one of 3 Gmail inboxes</strong>, my work email via <strong>Microsoft Exchange</strong>.</p><hr /><p>This is a list of apps in which I can put things I care about. They all have incredibly discrete functions in which they’re invaluable to me, but they all each have storage capabilities too. There’s also all the physical papers and forms and stuff filed away in a bookcase.</p><p>Thank goodness cross-platform search technologies these days aren’t awful, because if I had to remember in which place I stored something, I would be lost pretty much constantly. As much as the app economy and tech startups fascinate me, it’s almost too easy to lose track of everything. If productivity tools like Workflow and IFTTT make it so much easier to keep things in sync, and there’s backup solutions galore, <strong>why does the digital side of my world still feel so fragmented?</strong></p><p>As much as <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/3098804/data-center-cloud/how-to-use-icloud-drive-s-new-desktop-and-documents-access-in-macos-sierra.html">Apple’s plan to store users’ entire Desktops and Documents folders within iCloud for syncing purposes</a> is slightly nerve-wracking, I appreciate the effort to help consumers keep their shit in one place. I realize this anxiety is partly my own neuroses and my being raised on a file system paradigm, but I also have to imagine that the fragmentation of the cloud storage (and general digital storage) markets are part of why tech is so overwhelming for some.</p><h1 id="twenty-eight-days-in">Twenty-eight days in</h1><p>The last post I wrote on my personal blog was back in September. That was a time when I was about to enter ** peak stress** - planning for my upcoming wedding was ramping up, I was about to enter my first e-commerce peak season as a senior manager at work, and I had just moved into new apartment. I used to be able to write entire pieces on a single train ride to work; now I can walk at my own pace to the office in half the time, at the expense of a dedicating writing session.</p><p>New Years Resolutions are stupid, but I had made one to write more.</p><p>Twenty-eight days later, I literally don’t know what to write given the past week with our new America. Instead, I think about my wife, my colleagues (many of whom are immigrants or on work visas). I think about egomania. I think about yelling and screaming and fighting for the rights of those I care about, plus everyone else who is entitled to those rights. I think about curling up and hiding.</p><p>Before the break, I used to write about technology and products and music things. It doesn’t seem right to do <em>just</em> that. It seems more appropriate to think about how I, a financially stable white man, deal with this. It seems appropriate to try and help amplify the voice of those suffering or overwhelmed by all of this, so these voices overpower that of the irrational and heartless and hypocritical. I’m not sure of all the ways I can do that, but I might as well try something.</p><h1 id="en-route">En route</h1><p>I’m currently with my wife in France, en route to Berlin, where we’ll be living for at least a year. My company is sending me there to do some product management things for its relatively young European business; more generally, we’re using it as an opportunity to live outside the US during a both personally and politically anxious time. I don’t want to talk any more about politics, since that’s basically all that American news talks about and it’s all stress all the time, so instead, here’s a picture of the lake Alicia and I are sitting next to: <img src="Image%208-21-17,%2013-07.png" /> This is Lac Annecy, a large lake next to a small and very cute city in Southeast France, right near the Alps. We’re here to detox from life for a few days before re-immersing in a somewhat different one in Germany. Because I naturally assimilate into the culture around me instead of actually trying to relax, here are a few quick observations about life in Annecy:</p><ul><li>Service in restaurants is slower, but also it’s so pleasant that I rarely ever mind.</li><li>Everyone says <em>bonjour</em>, <em>bonsoir</em>, <em>pardon</em> and <em>au revoir</em> to each other - almost no exceptions. It doesn’t feel fake either; the locals seem genuinely cordial and kind, almost like a European version of Southern hospitality. If you don’t speak English, there is a genuine attempt to try and make the language barrier work (though the variability of English understanding here is wide).</li><li>I feel like an asshole trying to fake French, realize I don’t know what I’m saying, and then asking for English. I need to learn German quickly.</li><li>Espresso is <em>much</em> better than coffee here. The best espresso.</li></ul><p>I hear the coffee is fantastic in Berlin.</p><h1 id="my-new-album-sleepwalker">My new album, Sleepwalker</h1><p><strong>TLDR: I finally finished an album of music and I’m ready to share it with you.</strong> It drops for real next Friday (2.1) on Bandcamp, and the following Friday (2.8) everywhere else (Spotify, Apple Music, and wherever else people find music). <strong>For a sneak preview, check out the first track “Belong 2” <a href="http://sophomoresmusic.com/album/sleepwalker">here</a>.</strong></p><p>This one’s weird, but also exciting, for a bunch of reasons:</p><ol><li>About half of it was produced, and most of it was mixed &amp; mastered, on an iPad Pro. It was the first time I worked on a collection of songs with a ton of restrictions in my gear setup, mostly because I was living in Berlin on expat assignment when most of it came together. I’ll write more about the production details later.</li><li>As a result of my limited access to gear &amp; instruments, much of it is piano- and beat-driven, and quite sparse in places. This was an interesting change of pace for me, since much of my older music was quite dense to the point where my voice was (likely intentionally) drowned out in the mix behind all sorts of guitars and synths and stuff. Here, my vocals are pretty right up front.</li><li>The songs themselves are from all over the place. “Sun Loop” came from a looped guitar sample I recorded in 2009 (weirdly recorded at an apartment down the street from the place I finished the song in). “Old Lady Mary Esther” is a cover of an amazing song my friend Mary wrote, and I had the fortune of performing with her, back in Brooklyn in 2014. “Forget” is a mix of lyrics I wrote while playing in a little stoner rock band in 2012, with some piano riffs I wrote while in college, and this killer beat I found a few months ago. “Totem/Trinket” uses another piano riff from that same period, but is mostly inspired by the creativity I found in Berlin juxtaposed with the relentless consumerism I felt returning to the States. It’s amazing to me how random, disparate ideas can sometimes come together.</li><li>Much of this came out of me watching my wife struggle with autoimmune disease. That will become pretty apparent by track 2 or 3.</li></ol><p>I really hope folks enjoy this. It’s the most confident I’ve felt in my songwriting and self-production.</p><h1 id="impostor-snowflake">Impostor snowflake</h1><p>It’s been a while since I finished writing and publishing something. I would love for this to be because I have an exciting thing to announce that I’ve been painstakingly working on for the last however many months.</p><p>But I don’t (at this point at least). I have personally nothing to add to the cesspool. (My wife does, though, and you should <a href="http://simplywellbyalicia.com">go to her new website</a>, yay!)</p><p>It’s not like I’ve felt no emotions or accomplished nothing in the past year. I’ve gone through a lot — my family has gone through a lot. I moved twice, settled twice, changed roles at my job, put out an album of music. I’ve felt anxiety, rage, excitement and joy through all of it. But none of it seems worth sharing.</p><p>Why is that?</p><p>I’ve also noticed my unwillingness to share things on social media platforms. I even had to set up a daily habit reminder (in an app called Streaks) to remind me to post a photo at least a few times a week.</p><p>Am I depressed? Maybe I’m depressed. Maybe I’m the old soul my wife keeps telling me I am. Mostly it never feels genuine. Except it is — I have real joy that I feel, but usually it’s in small quirks that my wife and I share. The occasional lyrical idea that comes to mind and gets written down but never gets seen by anyone but myself and Apple’s servers. The most public things I do currently are this obscure blog and my day job work, which is conventionally sexy but often feels like something everyone in e-commerce is already doing.</p><p>I don’t get off on winning. I get off on originality. Why is it so hard to find that? Am I just too risk-averse to go look for it?</p><p>Do people who actually share also exhibit these same feelings? What is the hurdle one must jump over to get past this feeling?</p><p>Do I just feel a need to individualize myself? I hate the idea of thinking that I’m a snowflake, but I think I feel awful and not worthy of anyone’s attention because I’m not a snowflake.</p><p>Is this ridiculous? Do people feel this?</p><h1 id="running-a-dumb-robot-vacuum-with-shortcuts">Running a dumb robot vacuum with Shortcuts</h1><p>I love the idea of a totally self-sufficient robotic vacuum to keep my floors clean. However, I am also cheap: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iRobot-Automatic-Disposal-Connected-Edge-Sweeping/dp/B07NVTMJPD/ref=sxin_5_ac_d_rm?keywords=roomba&amp;pd_rd_i=B07NVTMJPD&amp;pd_rd_r=8e4c84bc-5f67-4929-af71-c3f4ee392806&amp;pd_rd_w=cnQ5c&amp;pd_rd_wg=i93iI&amp;pf_rd_p=0bc35c17-1e0d-4808-b361-20ab11b00973&amp;pf_rd_r=CA8HXGP9FD1CD2YMFHQT&amp;qid=1560629136&amp;s=gateway">a $1000 Roomba that empties its own waste</a> is amazing, but not something I’m willing to chalk up for at this point in my life.</p><p>So, I got an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ECOVACS-Robotic-Cleaner-Low-pile-Connected/dp/B06XVXRYTM">Ecovacs Deebot N79</a> for sale on Amazon a few months ago. It’s great, but it’s also pretty dumb. Alicia and I call it DJ Roomba (<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pXhsUPtsiLU">obviously</a>), and it’s very cute but kind of dumb.</p><p>It can schedule itself to run daily at a certain time, but no more granularly than that — I don’t want to hear a vacuum at 11am when I’m at home, but I do appreciate coming home to a clean house when I’m out and about. It does have Wifi capability and a companion iPhone app, but the app sucks: it requires 2 taps and several seconds of delay just to find DJ Roomba, and then I have to tell it what to do, and every time I want it to do something different I need to repeat this entire process.</p><p>It’s not great. I’d rather just build a scheme that DJ Roomba can follow automatically, whenever I want it to.</p><h3 id="homebridge-and-its-flaws">Homebridge and its flaws</h3><p>I naturally Google’d the crap out of this problem. I quickly found <strong><a href="https://github.com/wpietri/sucks/blob/master/protocol.md">sucks</a></strong>, a Python interface that connects to Ecovacs’ server and then enables one to issue commands to any robovacuums tied to your Ecovacs account. This was easy enough to set up. I then found a way to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homebridge/comments/8e1h7r/plugin_for_the_ecovacs_deebot_n79/">connect <code>sucks</code> to Homebridge via a plugin called CmdSwitch2</a>.</p><p>I had never used <a href="https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge">Homebridge</a> before, but I love the potential of HomeKit. I already have a moderately robust HomeKit setup in my apartment: some smart bulbs, a couple of switches (including a critically placed one controlling my modem) and a HomePod to yell at, so installing Homebridge on my Mac seemed like a fun little project.</p><p>Turns out I suck at and don’t enjoy the command line. The process of setting up Homebridge, connecting all the dots between Python, <code>sucks</code>, <code>cmdswitch2</code> as a trigger that exists inside Homebridge’s config, and Homebridge itself, was a tedious process that quickly lost my interest. I kept having to kill and restart Homebridge to make sure everything was playing nice. I must have scanned the Homebridge QR code into my iPhone’s Home app twenty times to get it registered as an accessory.</p><p>The other major challenge: I didn’t want my wife to have to deal with this either, but we share an iMac. She uses it regularly for work, and often has to kill processes in order for Adobe apps to run optimally, or restart the computer if things go wrong — which also killed my Homebridge server. I found some options to automatically restart the server, and I could have kept trying those things, but my fun little hobby project of <em>automating control of my dumb vacuum</em> was increasingly frustrating me. I’d go to start the vacuum and constantly see the damn “No Response” in red.</p><p>So I gave up and dismantled the entire thing.</p><p>A few weeks later I realized that I don’t actually need Homebridge or <code>cmdswitch2</code> at all. I really just wanted to run <code>sucks</code> on command: ideally a specific times of day or when I’m home, but just being able to trigger it from any of my devices (or my voice) would suffice.</p><p>Enter crazy and powerful <strong>Shortcuts</strong>.</p><h3 id="shortcuts-and-a-simple-applescript">Shortcuts and a simple AppleScript</h3><p>Nobody I know personally really uses Shortcuts, but it’s sort of my lifeblood for controlling things around my home and work. I use it to set reminders without thinking, do a whole host of chores every morning &amp; weekend, and generate canned email templates that I shouldn’t have to send as often as I do.</p><p><a href="http://twitter.com/viticci">Viticci</a> opened my eyes to the idea of <a href="https://www.macstories.net/shortcuts/#mac">Shortcuts triggering actions on a remote Mac via SSH</a>, including waking it from sleep. I figured out that I could also run AppleScripts using the an SSH command — <code>osascript</code>.</p><p>I realize that most tech people probably know this already, but bear with me.</p><p>I then did the following:</p><ol><li>On my shared iMac, opened up Script Editor and created an AppleScript (.scpt) file that run a basic <code>sucks</code> command: <code>sucks edge 15 clean 30 charge</code>. This script, when run, tells Ecovacs to run the “edge” function on my vacuum for 15 minutes, then general cleaning for a half hour, then send the vacuum back to its charger.</li><li>Saved that .scpt file my parent user directory on the iMac.</li><li>In Shortcuts, wrote a very simple (1-step) Shortcut that triggers script via SSH. Rather than SSH-ing into the iMac locally, I enable SSH access and file sharing on the iMac, then connect to its IP address so I can run the command from anywhere.</li><li>Repeated steps 1, but with a different script that simply tells DJ Roomba to go home, it’s drunk: <code>sucks charge</code></li></ol><p>Now I have two Shortcuts: Run Vacuum and Stop Vacuum. I can yell out to my HomePod, tap a button on my iPhone or iPad, to kick either process off. As long as my iMac is <em>on</em>, this will always work.</p><p>I can run this as part of another shortcut, such as my Bedtime Ritual one which darkens some lights around the home and reminds me to floss, clean out Roomba’s dustpan and a few other things. I can even have Reminders remind me to run the Run Vacuum shortcut at specific times or locations — for example, anytime I leave my house. Then, in one tap, DJ Roomba is up to his antics.</p><h3 id="the-possibility-in-ios-13">The possibility in iOS 13</h3><p>This works really nicely, but it’s not perfect. I’d love to customize even further when and how DJ Roomba can run. It sounds like this all gets unlocked in iOS 13 via Shortcuts Automations. I’ll be able to, for example, run the vacuum on Saturdays as long as nobody is home, something I can do currently but <em>only</em> with HomeKit accessories.</p><p>This is really dumb and nerdy, but I find it satisfying and fun.</p><h1 id="the-sticks">The sticks</h1><p>My wife and I are celebrating our third wedding anniversary doing a great New England tradition: shoveling snow. A lot of snow.</p><p><img alt="Snow makes the yard all pretty and nice" src="1220C3CD-77D3-456D-8400-1489B1DDAC35.jpeg" /></p><p>Being a homeowner in the sticks is a big, weird adjustment. Don’t get me wrong: it’s amazing. Our little neighborhood is so quiet, picturesque and friendly.</p><p>But now we have to maintain a big, very expensive thing and the land around it (and/or pay people to help maintain things when I cannot — shoutout to all the great plumbers), and if I neglect to maintain it, things could become very bad. Also, the big, very expensive thing happens to be the place in which we both live, work and sleep, so the stakes are pretty high.</p><p>The weirdest part to me is that I’ve enjoyed all the maintenance and projects. Digging into HomeKit and finding new uses for my Raspberry Pi are my new favorite tinkering hobbies, I’m learning a crazy amount about construction and electrical and how things work. What was stressful is now fulfilling.</p><p>Here’s to you and our beautiful new home, my love.</p><h1 id="309-clarity-is-out-the-disinfected-window">3.09: Clarity is out the disinfected window</h1><p>I don’t know about you, but I am very overwhelmed at the moment and pretty much all the time. Leave it to a global pandemic to cause people to fundamentally reconsider how people work and communicate and live their lives.</p><p>I’m not personally leading a vastly different life compared to how it was two weeks ago: working remote in a farm town with no close friends less than a 45-minute drive away doesn’t really lend itself to lifestyle changes in the face of a highly contagious virus. I’m not even terribly stir-crazy, since our puppy Rosie is getting me outside four to five times a day to urinate, defecate and/or run around the yard.</p><p>But I’m feeling a different stir-craziness, one that is much more psychological. My mind is racing constantly despite multiple attempts to calm it down. I am exhausted at the end of every day, passing out in my bed but somehow waking up feeling poorly rested. It took something like seven attempts to even get this short and not-particularly-groundbreaking post together.</p><p>I referred back to my “clarity” note which drove my goals for 2020, and pretty much everything is out the window at this point: it’s a struggle to be intentional, I’m not reading, I’m not actively creating, breathing only helps for a few minutes before this weird reality sets back in. The only thing that is progressing is my ability to let anxiety about homeownership go, simply because it’s the last thing on my mind right now.</p><p>I am having visceral urges to create <em>something</em> but I can’t form a single complete thought around what I could do. It almost feels like the entire world is up for disruption, so there’s a need (or opportunity?) to create things in these trying times, but I can’t achieve the level of mental fortitude required to actually do it. It’s a struggle to come up with an original thought when everyone is seemingly feeling the same: either “I am terrified and confused” or “I refuse to acknowledge this reality.”</p><p>I don’t really have anything to share for insights, advice, or reflection that hasn’t been already shared. If this experience has taught me anything, it’s that the Internet is wonderful for not feeling alone, but it kind of sucks if you’re feeling the urge to do something original.</p><p>But mostly I thought the title of this post was cheeky, and wanted to post it for that.</p><h1 id="313-zoom-is-where-we-hang-out-now">3.13: Zoom is where we hang out now</h1><h2 id="in-which-a-pandemic-changes-how-everyone-lives-but-not-us-so-much-which-is-weird-even-though-all-of-it-is-pretty-weird">In which a pandemic changes how everyone lives, but not us so much, which is weird, even though all of it is pretty weird</h2><p>I missed my own writing deadline this week. I resolved to post <em>something</em> to my newsletter every Monday, and this week I failed.</p><p>It’s a weird week to think about committing to <em>anything</em>, to be honest. Everyone’s either in or contemplating a self-quarantine; Alicia and I have basically been quarantining for weeks now. By nature of both of us both working from home, we’re basically mostly at home — save an occasional dog walk or grocery run or outing to a sparsely populated place. Yesterday I did the obligatory bulk-supplies run to BJ’s Wholesale, so now we have months worth of frozen and non-perishable food. Alicia and I have probably spent the majority of our time trying to relax together while acknowledging our crippling anxieties, which in a way has been a bit therapeutic and has certainly brought us together. (That and washing our hands and sanitizing &amp; re-sanitizing our stuff when we forgot to wash our hands before touching something.)</p><p>I feel for the folks living alone, working at home alone or generally being stuck inside little boxes in cities, which is where we were only a few months ago. For me, not much has changed since moving out to the sticks: I’ve been working at home, so has my spouse, and neither of us generally go out much between where we live and our anxieties. Alicia has repeatedly stated that, for her, this amount of hand-washing and nervousness and generally trying to avoid crowds is what she’s done for years.</p><p><strong>But I am still feeling a bit of the isolation problem that everyone is writing and/or worried about.</strong> It’s really nice having a wife and puppy at home to love, but there are other people in this world that I like, and my work and hobbies and other distractions only go so far. I’ve FaceTimed a bit with family but that’s differently frustrating. Also frustrating has been my attempts to stay in the loop via social media: a lot of the people I follow seem to be posting a lot about their coronavirus-driven isolation, but it doesn’t feel like we’re doing much about it.</p><p>Should we all just get on Zoom calls and hang out, then?</p><p>We remote workers have been doing this forever, as a means to build team camaraderie: book a time to jump on Zoom, as a group, and talk about anything <em>but</em> work. We call it, unironically, a Hangout, or sometimes a “coffee chat” but that implies a certain amount of work-ness. A Hangout on the other hand feels like what we do when we go to a bar, or someone’s house, and just – hey – hang out.</p><p>Seriously, though: everyone’s talking about Zoom in the context of remote work, so why not leverage this (or Skype or group FaceTime or pick-your-online-gaming-platform or whatever else) to just hang out with each other? Are people already doing this?</p><p>I’m game if you are. I have booze in the house; I’m sure you do too. It’ll kind of be like going to a bar?</p><h1 id="302-earworms-suck">3.02: Earworms suck</h1><p>I don’t want to talk about work or technology or bettering oneself this week. I want to talk about the thing that was stuck in my head for the majority of the past week, which was the following phrase: <em>“We can’t find the books; they must be in La Jolla.”</em></p><p>This is from a sample used in the song <a href="#">“If Not Now, Whenever” by The Books</a>(https://music.apple.com/us/album/if-not-now-whenever/410842405?i=410842414), a wonderful experimental folk duo that was moderately popular in hipster circles in the early-mid 2000s. The song itself is fine: pretty repetitive, hypnotic melody, a little boring but also fun for a deep cut. There’s a seemingly random string of voices throughout the song – they don’t tell a story from what I can tell, but the end of one phrase seems to lead into the next. This sample comes up randomly in the middle in the song, after a few old women asking about “the books.” It’s unclear whether this is a meta-reference to the band or a commentary on how people consume media.</p><p>I don’t know what else it could be, but the phrase just <em>sounds good</em> to me. It sits in the rhythm really nicely, and it’s spoken sardonically and cool. It’s not some deeply catchy, intricately-produced melody manufactured to optimize profits; it’s a passing sample likely meant as a joke.</p><p><strong>I have a horrible habit of getting small parts of songs stuck in my head for long periods of time, and then having those songs incessantly distract me.</strong></p><p>I just discovered Poppy, whose whole <a href="#">vibe and backstory</a>(https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/poppy-i-disagree/) is <em>insane</em>, and essentially put out a melodic death metal record. There are parts of her new album <em>I Disagree</em> which are certainly catchy, but metal rarely captures my attention these days. I’ve had various parts of <a href="#">the lead track “Concrete”</a>(https://music.apple.com/us/album/concrete/1481273823?i=1481273844) stuck in my head for weeks (something about that “sugar on my teeth” line), and recently became obsessed with the refrain from <a href="#">“Fill The Crown.”</a>(https://music.apple.com/us/album/fill-the-crown/1481273823?i=1481274007)</p><p>Back-to-back with Poppy has been <a href="#">“You Make My Dreams” by Hall &amp; Oates</a>(https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-make-my-dreams/273750173?i=273750245). Talk about a topic jump: from being ironically buried alive in concrete, I move to a simple love confession. I’ve had this track on-and-off stuck in my head since 2016, when it was on seemingly infinite repeat during my best man’s own bachelor party. There’s no need to explain what makes this song an ear worm: it’s probably stuck in <em>your</em> head too from time to time. <a href="#">One scientist calls it a “cognitive itch,”</a>(https://<a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2901/why-do-songs-get-stuck-in-your-head/">www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2901/why-do-songs-get-stuck-in-your-head/</a>) which seems appropriate for this particular track.</p><p>Cognitive itching seems overall appropriate for the whole sensation inspiring this post. Instead of scratching a technical itch or a career itch, I find myself regularly and incessantly scratching sonic itches in my brain. Sometimes this comes to the detriment of one of those other itches; I think my inability to parse Swift documentation and make sense of inexplicable bugs partly relates to my brain being distracted by those melodies and samples that won’t leave.</p><p>Some of these songs <em>are</em> incredibly catchy and have fair right to be called earworms, but others get stuck in my head for seemingly no reason whatsoever. I said the word “cocoon” this morning, and now I have <a href="#">“Cocoon” by Björk</a>(https://music.apple.com/us/album/cocoon/20920260?i=20920271) stuck in my head. It’s not even that catchy of a song; her vocal melodies are usually more meandering than crisp. (This was not written for effect – this specifically happened at 8am this morning, Monday, March 2nd.) I’ve been following the pianist/MC Jason Charles Beck (aka Chilly Gonzales) for a while, and I’ve had his track <a href="#">“I Am Europe”</a>(https://music.apple.com/us/album/i-am-europe/962969143?i=962969153) stuck in my head recently. It’s got a somewhat catchy piano riff, but vocally there’s nothing to hang onto whatsoever: there’s a weird string of spoken-word metaphors in the middle of the song that ring quite hollow (“I’m a dog shit ashtray”; “I’m a toilet with no seat, flushing tradition down”), but the piano line, undercut with pitched moans, just works for me. I haven’t listened to this song or album in years, and there’s no reason for me to either –– it’s not <em>that</em> great. But it’s in my head.</p><p>Sometimes the nature of these earworms are subtle and specific. Another song I frequently get stuck in my head is <a href="#">“You With Air” by Young Magic</a>(https://music.apple.com/us/album/you-with-air/498847282?i=498847285), which is fun and catchy as hell. It shares a vocal line almost identically with <a href="#">Purity Ring’s “Grandloves”</a>(https://music.apple.com/us/album/grandloves-feat-young-magic/540020916?i=540020924), but I rarely if ever think about that song. I have no idea why, despite having the Young Magic version of the line in my head frequently. The context of the backing rhythm and overall vibe seem to matter.</p><p>It feels narcissistic to get <a href="#">one of my own songs</a>(https://music.apple.com/us/album/sun-loop/1451324257?i=1451324264) stuck in my head, but I have a little guitar and bass line loop stuck in my head. I guess one could call that part of the songwriting process, but this particular loop has been in and out of my head since 2009. I guess you could call it catchy once the vocal melody is attached, but the guitar loop is kind of nothing on its own. I can’t explain it, which I guess is the whole thesis of this post. (I guess it’s also weird to link to said song in my own newsletter. Shameless.)</p><p>I wonder what some earworms tell me about my inner demons. I have a strong distaste for horror movies –– inexplicable gore and chaos make me very uncomfortable –– but sometimes I’ll scratch an aural itch that would be terrifying to most people. Mr. Bungle, a bizarre, fun and sometimes confusing band from the 90s recently announced a small set of reunion shows in California which prompted me to revisit some of their music. I recently got stuck in my head <a href="#">a song of theirs called “Carry Stress In The Jaw”</a>(https://music.apple.com/us/album/carry-stress-in-the-jaw/358575638?i=358575688), a song about grinding one’s teeth during sleep, specifically the jittery saxophone line that begins the song and a bit of the following verse. Any rational person would likely find this song terrifying, between the jarring tonal &amp; genre shifts, the chainsaw-sounding guitars, and Mike Patton’s meandering recitation of an Edgar Allan Poe excerpt which builds to a high-pitched wail. But I find it a fascinating and ultimately entertaining listen, and I apparently get fixated on parts of it from time to time. What does this say about me? The aforementioned Poppy tracks are unconventional and dark but ultimately (as her moniker states –– hey!) poppy and interesting social commentary; “Carry Stress In The Jaw” is chaotic, strange, and sometimes gross without a clear point. Is this a reflection that my mind is in a proverbial gutter? Is this a manifestation of the actual teeth-grinding I do while I sleep? Am I a glutton for aural punishment?</p><p>More likely I just am fascinated by sound, but I can’t help but worry about my sanity with a track like this.</p><p>I made a playlist of these songs that I keep pretty up-to-date, for those interested; there’s a lot rattling around in my brain. Check it out <a href="#">here</a>(https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/earworms/pl.59ab7b0764e34a45b64984ac80e94ee6).</p><hr /><p>This was fun to write. I didn’t really learn anything for have any nuggets of value to share, but it was nice to shove stressful or effortful things aside and just ramble about songs I like. We should be doing more stuff like this.</p><h1 id="224-found-my-stuff">2.24: Found my stuff</h1><p>I’m incredibly lucky to have a little bit of time to pursue hobbies or interests outside of my work and family life. One of the <a href="#">interests I’d been exploring</a>(https://tonedeafcolorblind.substack.com/p/210-everyones-a-workaholic-and-other) was app development: I am deeply in love with the iOS/iPadOS ecosystem and have always wanted to tinker within it and contribute to it. Plus, I’d played a little with development before by running a few Wordpress sites in the past, doing low-complexity coding and bug fixes in previous gigs, and spending most of my workweek talking with other developers for a job. <strong>And I had an idea for an app that would actually be useful to me.</strong></p><p>So I tried picking up Swift and SwiftUI to develop said app. After about 10 days I’ve given up. I either don’t have the brain, or the patience, for software development. I get the model-view-controller framework completely – I need to at least <em>understand</em> this concept to do my day job, but while I can sort of read code, it’s a whole order of magnitude of complexity for me to write it <em>and</em> not run into a dozen build failures or inexplicable crashed. The place where I got stuck, specifically, was around supporting Siri Intents: the idea involved needing to talk to Siri, or build Shortcuts, around locating a specific piece of data, and I got incredibly frustrated trying to figure this out. <a href="#">Tech pundits are right when they say Apple’s documentation is not useful</a>(https://atp.fm/episodes/363), and I don’t have the skillset to adapt examples from other people to my own use cases.</p><p>The idea stuck, though. It came out of an episode of the <a href="#">wonderful <em>Reconcilable Differences</em> podcast</a>(https://overcast.fm/+E5INvkfOI/10:17). In this one, John Siracusa talks about his use of Apple Notes to keep a running list of where random things are in his house. Turns out I could have used one of those: <strong>My wife and I move random items around the house regularly and then forget where we put them.</strong> Some of these are easy to track down, such as AirPods or our phones, because we can yell out to Siri and then a loud bell will be emitted from said device. I wanted to be able to yell out to Siri, “Where’s my goddamn box cutters?” when I have a dozen cardboard boxes to break down and can’t find them. The only options I could think of were to buy a <a href="#">Tile</a>(https://<a href="http://www.thetileapp.com">www.thetileapp.com</a>) or wait for <a href="#">Apple’s competing product</a>(https://<a href="http://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/">www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/</a>), but I also don’t want to spend hundreds (possibly thousands) of dollars putting a Bluetooth tracker on all my tools, random cables, passport, etc. Not to mention all the <a href="#">problems</a>(https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/01/bleedingbit-security-flaws-bluetooth-wireless-networks/) with <a href="#">Bluetooth</a>(https://<a href="http://www.foxnews.com/tech/turn-off-your-bluetooth-warn-security-experts">www.foxnews.com/tech/turn-off-your-bluetooth-warn-security-experts</a>) <a href="#">security</a>(https://<a href="http://www.wired.com/story/bluetooth-complex-security-risk/">www.wired.com/story/bluetooth-complex-security-risk/</a>) and <a href="#">electromagnetic radiation in the house</a>(https://<a href="http://www.healthline.com/health-news/are-wireless-headphones-dangerous#Scientists-believe-the-current-EMF-guidelines-are-inadequate">www.healthline.com/health-news/are-wireless-headphones-dangerous#Scientists-believe-the-current-EMF-guidelines-are-inadequate</a>).</p><p><strong>So instead of frustrating myself endlessly trying to build a swanky app to solve this problem and then monetizing it for no good reason, I built a group of shortcuts to help me with keeping track of shit around the house.</strong></p><h3 id="found-it-the-shortcut-suite">Found It, the shortcut suite</h3><p>Collectively they’re called <strong>Found It</strong>, and they enable you to securely tell Siri where your stuff is around the house. When you can’t find one of those things, just ask Siri and she’ll tell you. If you put that thing somewhere else, just tell Siri and she’ll remember next time you can’t find it.</p><p>If you like, you can tap on the links below to download Found It and all its components:</p><ul><li><a href="#">Found It</a>(https://<a href="http://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/934134a4d9d041bf887295cb53e9a7ca">www.icloud.com/shortcuts/934134a4d9d041bf887295cb53e9a7ca</a>) (the master Shortcut, which does everything)</li><li><a href="#">Keep Track of Something</a>(https://<a href="http://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/1a70d1021e8643bab99a0c68481f8efc">www.icloud.com/shortcuts/1a70d1021e8643bab99a0c68481f8efc</a>) (just asks Siri to track something new)</li><li><a href="#">Help Me Find Something</a>(https://<a href="http://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/04f01a26eb474a89b42a9bc683c13d10">www.icloud.com/shortcuts/04f01a26eb474a89b42a9bc683c13d10</a>) (just asks Siri to look up where something is)</li><li><a href="#">I Moved Something</a>(https://<a href="http://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/81941086663b44249bc4266ac47fa012">www.icloud.com/shortcuts/81941086663b44249bc4266ac47fa012</a>) (just tells Siri the new location of something)</li></ul><p>From there, you can start tracking your own stuff. These shortcuts also support custom inputs, so you can make your own mini-Shortcuts that ask Siri for a specific item (so you don’t have to re-specify every single time). For example, I made a shortcut to ask Siri “Where’s the hammer?” since I keep leaving my hammer in random places around the house, and she’ll just tell me that.

Thanks for listening!</p><h1 id="217-so-layoffs-are-weird">2.17: So, layoffs are weird</h1><p>This past week <a href="#">my previous employer laid off roughly 3% of its staff</a>(https://<a href="http://www.boston.com/news/business/2020/02/13/wayfair-layoffs">www.boston.com/news/business/2020/02/13/wayfair-layoffs</a>). A lot of people lost jobs, and I personally worked with about two dozen of them and knew those folks pretty well.</p><p>😞</p><p>I’m not going to pretend that this was a massively unexpected surprise; this is absolutely something that happens with over-hiring and mismanagement of performance for large groups of skilled employees. I’m surprised it hadn’t happened already, to be completely honest. But I can’t ignore the fact that layoffs are a really weird thing and I’ve been thinking about it more than I care to in the past few days.</p><p>Layoffs are especially weird in 21st-century society, in that we’re able to easily rally for each other on a social network and get out of laid-off status in a matter of hours. I posted twice on LinkedIn offering to help or talk to anyone affected by the layoffs, and these were <em>by far</em> the most popular posts I’ve ever made on a social network, ever. Not only did laid-off folks appreciate it (I spend much of yesterday afternoon responding to folks looking for tips on remote work), but dozens of former colleagues, current colleagues and people I’ve never met liked and commented on what I had to say. Most of those people also had their thing to say, and most of the thoughts were exactly the same: offers to help or talk, the processing of “many feelings” with ultimate optimism and gratitude.</p><p>It almost feels compulsory, that you <em>must</em> post about one of these things because everyone else in your circle is already doing it: if you’re not grateful to the employer that laid you off, you’re an ass. That compulsory feeling leads it the emotions feeling fake. I genuinely do want to help because I think a lot of highly-skilled and intelligent people aren’t aware of the possibilities out there beyond open office environments at well-intentioned-but-sometimes-overzealous e-commerce companies. I also want to make sure folks are okay with expressing frustration or constructive criticism at their previous employers, because without that it’s hard to imagine companies getting smarter about how they hire and evaluate the need for teams &amp; individuals if everyone’s grateful for the company that took away their lifeline on a moment’s notice.</p><p><a href="#">At least people come together to help each other in the face of a bad situation.</a>(https://<a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/13/business/these-people-will-have-jobs-two-weeks-if-they-want-them/">www.bostonglobe.com/2020/02/13/business/these-people-will-have-jobs-two-weeks-if-they-want-them/</a>)</p><p>I saw some recruiter posting about a job fair for the folks affected, and his post mentioned layoffs at another company. I then started digging and realized just how many companies – large, highly-reputed, tech companies – are growing too quickly or cannot meet the demand of the market in which they compete. <a href="#">Tripadvisor had layoffs last month</a>(https://patch.com/massachusetts/needham/tripadvisor-layoff-200-workers), <a href="#">AthenaHealth did last year</a>(https://<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2019/04/23/more-layoffs-at-athenahealth.html">www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2019/04/23/more-layoffs-at-athenahealth.html</a>), so did <a href="#">State Street</a>(https://<a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2019/01/18/state-street-to-lay-off-1-500-in-turn-toward.html">www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2019/01/18/state-street-to-lay-off-1-500-in-turn-toward.html</a>), and <a href="#">there are rumors flying around that LogMeIn also did</a>(https://<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/logmein/comments/f2j390/annual_layoffs/">www.reddit.com/r/logmein/comments/f2j390/annual_layoffs/</a>) recently. Turns out dozens of Boston-based companies have had pretty major layoffs in the past decade.</p><p>Another friendly reminder that the primary goal of these businesses is to grow and profit, and the care of its employees is predominantly secondary. If you can find a place where you’re felt taken care of well enough, then good on you.</p><hr /><p>It’s hard to be helpful in a way that doesn’t feel alienating to someone. Here’s an attempt.</p><p>Some advice to anyone who was surprised by it: pay more attention to your employer’s hiring goals, earnings calls, performance review process and the perceived performance of those around you. You’ll quickly realize that there’s plenty of places from which to trim fat in a pinch.</p><p>Or here’s some other advice that I’m working on myself: make it so that a layoff doesn’t affect you. This can be done in multiple ways, but here are two I’ve really focused on:</p><ul><li>Pay very close attention to how your current or next employer runs things: how it spends money, its hiring goals, how it runs performance evaluations, where its profits come from. Ask questions if you don’t understand things or don’t find the information you’re looking for. If you can’t get answers, think about why you’re not getting answers. Ideally, you’ll find a company that is clear with how it runs things and that aligns with your values.</li><li>Don’t be confined by where you live. Yes, relocation can be hard, but also, <strong>remote work is very much a thing that you should not ignore</strong>. A quick search with the right keywords (think “remote <a href="#">position</a> jobs”) will net you some interesting stuff to consider. If you like being in an office, coworking spaces do exist, and some companies will even cover this expense if you play your cards right.</li><li>Build up safety nets in other work, and, if you can, find a job that will enable you the time to do this. This is the classic <em>side hustle</em> argument. Most people I know who work in tech are so consumed by their work that it feels impossible to make time to do things on the side. My advice? Unless you truly love your work, don’t work for companies that consume you. My previous employer was one of those, and while I loved the work for a long time, once I stopped loving it I needed to get out.</li></ul><p>I’ll stop talking now.</p><h1 id="210-everyones-a-workaholic--other-related-concerns">2.10: Everyone’s a workaholic &amp; other related concerns</h1><p>Hello, Valentine’s Day week. May you all purchase for your significant others a greeting card as mushy as the one I purchased for mine.</p><p>Part of my theme of <strong>clarity</strong> has involved figuring out how I use my time &amp; tools: deleting apps and accounts that don’t add value, keeping an accurate calendar, setting deliberate goals for my interests &amp; projects and seeing how I move those forward. I’ve attempted and failed at time tracking three times already this year (probably due to <a href="#">my comfort in scattered focus</a>(https://tonedeafcolorblind.substack.com/p/fits-starts)), but I don’t feel the need for it <em>because</em> of the clarity I’m bringing to the <em>why</em> behind what I choose to do. I want to pursue a lot of scattered interests, and this clarity is helping me pick one to focus on when I’m bored or unsure, which is helpful because the list is long:</p><ul><li>Write more music for solo piano</li><li>Listen to more music with intentional focus</li><li>Regularly write and grow a newsletter (hey!)</li><li>Write a speculative fiction novel</li><li>Learn Swift and make 1 of 3 different iOS app ideas</li><li>A bunch of DIY projects around the house</li><li>Find opportunities to automate things around the house</li><li>Start a punk band</li><li>Buying and building a few Lego sets</li><li>And probably others I can’t think of at the moment</li></ul><p>There were multiple nights in January and early February during which I <em>wanted</em> to work on one of those things I resolved to start doing this year, but sometimes one just wants to watch a wonderful television show or spin a record. But there persists a nagging feeling. An itch not being scratched.</p><p>I have a lot of itches. One involves forming chords on a piano keyboard, another involves what you’re reading right now, several require spending money, most involve just building <em>something</em> cool. I’m not a skilled programmer, but I’ve wanted to become good at it so I could eventually make a product on my own. And then I realized that <strong>#nocode</strong> is a thing: No-code development, the idea (or now a movement, I guess) that there are dozens of cheap, scalable services out there on the Internet now which can be strung together to form a meaningfully viable business operation. I could spin up an idea of my own in a weekend.</p><p>As per usual I’m incredibly late to the party: Personalities on Twitter spinning out consulting services to help fellow no-coders, whole premium communities where indie hackers bounce ideas and team up.</p><p>There’s a lot of passion in those forums. But that passion seems as much about the money as the idea. It almost sounds desperate sometimes.</p><p>I am grateful that while I have lots of itches I’m trying to scratch, I don’t feel <em>desperate</em> to pursue them. I’m not truly sure if others feel that way, but the Internet sure makes it feel like it. Everyone in my social circle is hustling, peddling, working. Pretty much all the time.</p><p>This isn’t just isolated to LinkedIn or weird, specialty forums: it seems to have taken over Instagram. I have reached the point where Facebook’s own app — yes, the app that my mother and her friends use more than people my own age — is more useful to me than Instagram. I swore off Facebook years ago: it had not been on my phone since 2017 I believe, and I used to only visit Facebook to un-check an occasional box that I didn’t realize was checked that was sending me an email. But since moving to a town where meaningful news and activity gets conducted on Facebook, I’ve had to reinstall it. It’s how I know whether my trash pickup will happen. It’s how I know whether there are emergency road closures due to weather. It’s how I know whether there are bobcats roaming in our local area from which I should keep my puppy away. I even get some nice family-centric updates in my news feed which I’ve carefully pruned to avoid political dross. I’ve received value by completely disabling virtually all other content in Facebook’s ecosystem from showing up, but even the occasional one that does is almost a reprieve from the workaholism I’m seeing elsewhere. Example: Facebook seems to be the only place I can see friends from high school talking about their kids and family — <em>not</em> their work.</p><p>Instagram, on the other hand, has devolved into nothing more than <em>escapes that no longer work for me</em> and <em>entities trying to convince me to buy their shit</em>. I’m now numb to beautiful photos of landscapes, home interiors and adorable pets — or, more likely, it’s impossible to feel that escape when every fourth story is a sponsored ad and 50+% of the escapist photos are really just graphics supporting a call to sign up or buy. (My wife’s Instagram feed is even worse.)</p><p>It’s extending into the real world. My wife and I need to make a conscious effort <em>not</em> to talk shop while eating meals. I consciously decided to move my blog to Substack because they make it really easy to monetize one’s writing. Irony.</p><p>Where does it stop, though? Everyone’s always asked the obligatory “What do you do?” as an ice-breaker, but we don’t seem to need it anymore because well just yell what we do at each other because we need to just to get by.</p><p>Talking only about your work all the time can’t be good for us. It must <em>inherently</em> add massive stakes to virtually every conversation you have; the discourse becomes centered on your income, your lifeblood. Sure, eventually <em>some</em> of those side hustles could become sustainable, zero-maintenance, passive income, and that’s the dream. But think about the psychological damage this is probably giving us.</p><p>No wonderful mindfulness apps are so popular: it’s not that they’re fashionable, it’s that all of us are regularly on the verge of a psychotic break.</p><p>I truly hope my fellow millennials have hobbies they can pour this anxiety into. <strong>The beauty of a hobby is that, if I lose interest, or if my interest changes shape, there are no psychological stakes.</strong> Sure, a hobby might become a money pit but at least it’s on your own volition. I can morph that hobby as I please and as my passion for it changes. The problem with all this hustle is that, even if you try an idea and it doesn’t work, you are <em>compelled</em> to move onto the next thing. Sure, you can take a break and watch a few episodes of <a href="#">insert HBO or Netflix show</a>, but that may come at a price of either active or dormant anxiety. I know this to be true because my wife struggles with this constantly as a self-employed person, and we’re doing pretty okay financially. What about everyone that isn’t?</p><p>I am incredibly grateful that I landed a fairly steady job where I can be impactful and do somewhat interesting work for solid pay. I am also grateful for the music industry’s collapse and subsequent homogenization, because it painfully forced me to become comfortable with treating my expensive academic vocation as a hobby and pivot to something more stable. When I decided to stop exploring music as a profession, it didn’t stop me from playing; when I decided <a href="#">I no longer enjoy live music</a>(https://tonedeafcolorblind.substack.com/p/peak-live-music-or-no-more-surprises), I kept recording music and listening to recorded music. I listen to new and old music constantly; I strive to engage in deep conversations around why great music is great. But I gave up on trying to make money on it, and it’s no longer a stress point in my life.</p><p>(Then again, maybe I should be trying to make money on that interest: <a href="#">I could have easily done something like this</a>(http://strongsongs.libsyn.com/website). There’s the fucking itch again, and here comes the psychotic break.)</p><p>Maybe I’m just overblowing this in my head. But I don’t think this internal swirl of frustration and concern for my fellow compulsive hustlers is misplaced. The feeling is exacerbated, too, because I don’t know what I can do to help, or even if the help is actually needed. Some people <em>love</em> the hustle, even though it burns me out and it occasionally cripples people I love with anxiety. There is only so much I can do to productively add to the world, tune out the noise in it, and focus on those I truly care about.</p><p>I have no other conclusion than that. Perhaps also I wish Lego sets were cheaper because then I’d just build those all night after a hard day’s staring at a laptop screen.</p><hr /><p>I apologize if that came off as angsty or from a place of privilege. Here’s to another week of trying to suck a little less in a world of chaos.</p><h1 id="everyones-a-workaholic">Everyone’s a workaholic</h1><p>There were multiple nights in January during which I <em>wanted</em> to work on one of those things I resolved to start doing this year, but sometimes one just wants to watch a wonderful television show or spin a record.

In that sense I should have posted this on Monday; damn you, life and your sudden obstacles.</p><p>Last year was the tenth anniversary of the iPad, and a lot of people wrote about it. A lot of it was purely reflective, but some folks evaluated whether the iPad was a success in those ten years. It’s undeniably a success from a sales perspective, but lots of people seem focused on the question of whether it was <strong>transformative</strong>: to the way we do computing, to the landscape of technology businesses, to the way people live their lives. There are a lot of ways in which a technology can be transformative, but much of the more critical chatter has been on whether it’s been transformative to the way we work.</p><p>John Gruber suggests that <a href="#">the iPad has drastically failed to significantly change industries like the Mac did ten years into its existence, largely due to weaknesses in software interaction design, specifically multitasking</a>(https://daringfireball.net/2020/01/the_ipad_awkwardly_turns_10). This didn’t sit well with me, and it took me a few days sitting with my iPad Pro to figure out why: mainly that comparing the trajectory of iPad in the 2010s to Mac in the 80s/early 90s feels like a fundamentally fraught, apples-to-oranges comparison.</p><ol><li><p>There is no mention of the fact that <strong>Apple computers in the 80s and 90s had no obvious device competition in the market at the time</strong> and thus the 10-year anniversary is an unfair comparison to give to the iPad. Solutions for designers effectively did not exist like they did once Adobe’s products for the Mac started coming out, and the iPad needed to compete with two other major ecosystems made by Apple itself: the Mac and the iPhone. We’re still seeing how the iPad fits into the larger ecosystem, but it’s already clear that it’s part of a larger picture, one where all types of work can be done on a suite of devices, each perfectly suited to the task at hand, rather than on a computing device at all. If anything, the type of transformation the iPad begat is different than that of the Mac: where the Mac redefined industries, the iPad helped to redefine the consumer technology ecosystem as being universal and multi-device.</p></li><li><p>We could talk about work &amp; industry changes, but there is little discussion about the changes iPad is bring to <em>how creators make things</em> and <em>how students learn.</em> I believe that iPad’s contribution in these areas are massive, even if not single-handedly, because they (and netbooks) have made full-on computing affordable to more people. There are countless examples showcasing and communities built around the iPad for <a href="#">photography</a>(https://thesweetsetup.com/using-ipad-photography-workflows/), <a href="#">music production</a>(https://<a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/592572/ipad-music-production/">www.cultofmac.com/592572/ipad-music-production/</a>), <a href="#">live music performance</a>(https://forum.audiob.us), <a href="#">writing</a>(https://<a href="http://www.techradar.com/how-to/mobile-computing/tablets/how-to-write-a-novel-on-an-ipad-1300438">www.techradar.com/how-to/mobile-computing/tablets/how-to-write-a-novel-on-an-ipad-1300438</a>). Sure, these may be more incremental in terms of technological changes, but the iPad has put those capabilities in the hands of more people, without professional training or large budgets, and enabling them to do those things anywhere. Sure, <a href="#">Chromebooks are probably used more widely in schools</a>(https://<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2855768/why-chromebooks-are-schooling-ipads-in-education.html">www.pcworld.com/article/2855768/why-chromebooks-are-schooling-ipads-in-education.html</a>), but without iPads, would there have been the same competitive push for Google to develop an extremely-low-cost netbook for students?</p></li><li><p>While multi-tasking on iPad does have issues, I disagree that it is fundamentally broken and I consider it a distraction from the main goals the iPad intends to achieve. I personally believe these interactions quite close and the issues I’ve experienced feel more like bugs and solvable with small improvements. I use multi-tasking almost every day on my iPad and, thanks likely to a bit of muscle memory and self-education. Ten years into the Mac, designers were using Macs for work, but it’s 2020 and I know hundreds of people who still struggle with their Macs and PCs but live and die by their iPads because of how much more intuitive it is for them (again, likely due to the learning curve being lessened by iPhones, but that should not diminish the importance of iPads).</p></li><li><p>Not really directly relevant, but something I think about a lot: since social media took over most discourse about technology, it seems that most people’s opinions on virtually anything is perceived as more extreme (especially in the negative) than it was in the 90s. We could very well be dinging the iPad and feeling nostalgic about the impact of previous technological innvations because everyone’s senses are being numbed all the time by vitriol nowadays.</p></li></ol><p>Laying all this out, I still do feel like the iPad has a long way to go. <strong>But this feels empirically exciting to me in a way that Macs won’t ever feel anymore.</strong> It seems unfair — almost unsafe — to hold technologies created nearly 30 years apart to the same rubric, as it runs the risk of dismissing technologies that could be changing the lives of many.</p><p>These days, I use my iPad for virtually every bit of computing in my life with three exceptions:</p><ul><li>Using and testing <a href="#">the product I manage for my job</a>(https://abstract.com);</li><li>Taking music ideas to finished product in Logic Pro X, which might become unnecessary over time; and</li><li>Running a <a href="#">Homebridge</a>(http://homebridge.io) server</li></ul><p>I distinctly use it for the following things:</p><ul><li>Reading</li><li>Writing and publishing said writing</li><li>Taking unstructured ideas and fleshing them out</li><li>Planning my days, nights and weekends</li><li>Communication that’s more than 1-2 sentences</li><li>Viewing and editing photos</li><li>Starting, and sometimes finishing, song productions</li><li>All my daily work for my job except for software testing (which, by the way, I can technically do on an iPad via a secure VNC connection to my MacBook Pro for work)</li></ul><p>Sure, I could be doing all these things on a Mac (or even an iPhone if I wanted to destroy my hands), but I don’t have to. I can do these things anywhere thanks to a cellular connection, hyperportability, perfectly-tailored apps, and a beautifully designed interface whose quirks are no more problematic than those of any other computing device. And to me, that’s transformative.</p><p>See y’all next week!</p><h1 id="a-bunch-of-crap-duct-taped-together">A bunch of crap duct-taped together</h1><h2 id="on-the-partially-smart-home-and-other-dependencies-in-my-life">On the partially smart home, and other dependencies in my life</h2><p>I have four unused Philips Hue bulbs and I don’t know what to do with them. I bought them for a previous apartment, in which I really wanted to play with Apple’s HomeKit protocol as a means to automatically dim the lights when it’s bed time.</p><p>I wanted to use them for the ceiling fan in our living room. However, the previous owners of the house put in a combination fan/light dimmer switch, and when the dimmer and smart bulbs interact with each other, the bulbs flicker annoyingly. I could replace that switch, but to do so the right way and keep smart bulbs in play, I’d need to convert the one combo switch into two separate switches (one for light, one for fan) because there is no HomeKit-compatible combo switch on the market (or any smart switches of this nature that I’ve been able to find).</p><p>There’s no sense using them in the basement. There are already lights down there, and I go down once a week to make sure there are no leaks or ghosts or anything, and then I come right back up.</p><p>It’s not worth trying to use them in the garage, where the ceiling nearly twenty feet high and I don’t own a ladder with which I can reach it.</p><p>I can’t use them in the office (or rather, the spare bedroom with a desk in it). I don’t have the desk space for a table lamp, and if I put them in the ceiling then they’ll be on the main light switch and I don’t want to deal with HomeKit errors when I accidentally shut the switch off. If I do use them in the ceiling fixture, then I’d need to either have them run on a motion sensor that detects when I’m in the room and train myself to stop using the switch, or replace the switch with a smart one which is more money blown on this stupid pointless really fun experiment.</p><p>Should I just buy some floor lamps as an excuse to use the bulbs? This option seems very dumb.</p><p>All of these options create more work and don’t solve any additional problems without said work. I could argue that this is a fun, mildly inexpensive hobby, but it’d be an incredibly first-world hobby. It would also be one my wife loathes because of how often I’m tinkering with it, and inadvertently breaking things like our security system or the bedside table lamps.</p><p>As mentioned in previous writings of mine, I’ve tried various means to get the things in my life working for me. Instead, they create more dependencies. The security system and garage doors are jerry-rigged into the Home app thanks to <a href="#">Homebridge</a>(https://homebridge.io), which required me to first invest in and learn how to run a <a href="#">Raspberry Pi</a>(https://<a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org">www.raspberrypi.org</a>) because I didn’t want to have a server running 24/7 on my Mac, and then</p><hr /><p>Of course I’m rambling about smart home dependencies on an actually important holiday like Martin Luther King Jr. Day.
