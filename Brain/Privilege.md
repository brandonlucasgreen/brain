# Privilege
I am a straight white man.

It’s often felt like I don’t have anything to add when publishing my own ideas because of the ideas published are those by white men. What’s the point of adding my own noise when there’s so many people whose voices have never been heard before? What’s unique about **my voice**?

It feels privileged as hell to have the following things, and I need to remind myself that I’m grateful to even have them at all in my life.

- property ownership
- space
- really just - things
