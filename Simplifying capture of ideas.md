# Simplifying capture of ideas
I have for too long relied on my memory for things. I am both getting older _and_ my responsibilities are growing, so I need to deal with this in a better way.

Some goals and requirements:
- Must be possible across iOS and macOS
- Must be in as few clicks/taps/steps as possible; ideally, the writing of the idea is the first of those steps as to avoid distraction or loss
- Make it easy to leverage the zettelkasten to link related ideas later. Any text editor will work to allow for this, but ideally one that recognizes backlinks
